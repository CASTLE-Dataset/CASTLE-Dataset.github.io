"The most fitting category for this segment is **Playing Games**.

The image shows multiple people gathered around a table with various items that appear to be game-related, such as cards and tokens. They are actively engaged with each other and the items on the table, suggesting a game is in progress.",0,3600," And then we just map it to some common thing. No, no, I'll take my question and ask you. Can I have a follow-on question? For any interactive challenge, is it expert novice or just novice? It's just expert. I would also say so. The other thing you have to consider at ACM Multimedia is that... Everybody is an expert. No, they are an expert in something, they are not going to be an expert in something. But you have a challenge session in parallel to five other things. We can make a challenge session in parallel to a welcome reception in the Guinness Storehouse if we wanted to It can be a droney event. You are kicking yourself, Tiko. Klaus, I have flashbacks of Bangkok when the drinks came early. We call it LRUI, Life Love Retrieval Under Influence. Was it Bangkok when drinks came early? No. it wasn't Greece.

If it's in a workshop in the Hyatt Parallel Hotel, which is the biggest room, and there's loads of other stuff happening at the same time, nobody gives a damn, it's just us. The question was experts and novices, right?"
"The image depicts a gathering of people in what appears to be a dining or living area, with a Christmas tree in the background and a table laden with items. Many individuals are seated around the table or in the surrounding area, engaged in conversations and possibly enjoying a meal or drinks. Given the presence of a festive atmosphere and people socializing, the most appropriate classification would be **Leisure Activities**.",0,3600, But Luca would know.
