The vegan community will look at this and cancel it straight away. 24 sausages. Mildly cooked bacon. I mean, technically you cannot milk an almond.

I just like touching the computer it doesn't matter you just need to pay attention to it beeping yeah I think we were cooking or either when I went to room or god knows I was working on my step count probably in a couple of minutes.

Talking,2826,258, Why don't we just get a load of chicken wings and some fried brie?
Leisure Activities,258,721," Yeah, RSA. What's the logical reason? So they can take an entire cow. Because when we said escape or a steak, it's a steak. I'd like to escape for dinner, I'd like a steak for dinner. Escape makes no sense anyway. We have a logical reason to buy 11 steaks. How did you figure out that? Okay, I'm going to go to my room and make this order. So what I'm ordering is a lot of chicken goujons for starters, but not too much. No, no, no, not a lot, just a piece. A gujran each for starter. When I see it, maybe Ali gets mine. 11 steaks. When you gonna kill us because we go to salmon factory after lunch. We gonna get free salmon. Every tour of the salmon factory costs 85 euro. What? For one person? Yes. So you probably will get some salmon to bring home. Bring home. But I cannot bring home because we don't have fridge Bring, bring, bring I am Do you have fridge here? I'll give it to you I'll eat it Fast I'll put it in my luggage Yes Because it's going to be really good smoked salmon It's going to be salmon The way you were walking yesterday, that was the best Yes, it's 85 euros each I'm going to eat it I'm going to eat it all this tourist stuff is starting to cost insane amounts of money and if you see restaurants especially if they kind of get into any guide or michelin after covet i think they just doubled"

Why is that open in the fridge? The ham? Is it open? Yeah. It should be open to hackers. Wait, maybe you're thinking about the other thing? The thing that we used to cook the ham? Oh yes, no, the pork belly. Yes, the pork belly. Who opened the pork belly? Well, we opened the pork belly when we made the pineapple fried rice, because there was ham in it, and we couldn't cook the ham quick enough. Also just for future reference, if you open up things, you might want to close them again. I did not open or close anything, so... You're blaming? We will investigate this. Hm? And the investigation will be forthcoming. Paul Baker will be confiscating this. I think the first day I think we need to make an acronym that starts out with 4-O or something like this.

Discussing,274,627," How much ham is this? That's two kilograms. Yeah, but is it enough for... Well, maybe we can do ham and potatoes for... Please look at it with the corn also. You can have the Jordan corn also. Maybe you should go to the city. We'll do the corn, something with a PCL. Let's do something with a PCL. You're welcome. We can do ham and potatoes for dinner. And then we just do roast potatoes. And mushrooms, you know what we can do? I'm going to go buy the vegetables. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Stop buying stuff. Let's come here. Just buying stuff does not fix the issue. Because we have all this stuff we throw away. Just a second. I'm starting to get annoyed by the lack of organization. Two kilograms of ham for tonight. Good potatoes. We can slice some mushrooms. We can make goulash of mushrooms. So it's going to be potato, ham, and mushrooms on top. With some. I wouldn't goulash the mushrooms. I would just grill or fry the mushrooms. You aren't getting to go and get the beef. No, because then we have a lot of stuff to throw out. We have to throw out the beef and a load of chicken because they all went off. We don't have enough meat for the rest of the rest of the What else do we need then? We only have We only have 12 sausages. We've got We've got two packets of bacon. And we have some white and black pudding. That's it. Yeah, but that's still a lot. It's not enough. What? For what? It's not enough for what? For breakfast tomorrow and lunch and dinner. Oh, no dinner tomorrow. No, no, no, no, no. And lunch is lasagna. Lunch is what a dude, just like breakfast. Lunch is lasagna. I cut all the cheeses. We have a bunch of other stuff. I cut all the cheeses tomorrow for breakfast. Everything. There is a cheese. I still have some cookies to make. Complex. Okay, maybe we don't have to go. Then we don't the next conference. I mean, if you know what you want and why you want it... No, no, no. Do you know about the third time? What's your favorite? I would probably just have put it in the oven on the slow roast. With some water under it? What? With some water under it to... It's a good one. I don't know exactly what kind water is. Is it smoke? Yes, because that's very close. Your camera is not working. So, is this hemp, in your opinion? I don't know, I have not seen, I mean, the ham is vacuum sealed. I have no reason to assume the ham would be bad. And it smoked. It will have some... The ham should be fine. Pre-cooked. The ham should be fine. I was normally... So then we do something with the ham. We do potatoes. See what kind of spices we have for the potatoes. Totally. Does this say the juice of ham? No, just roast potatoes. For the sauce, no, no, sauce. I'm gonna make mushrooms. Put, slice them, make a goulash sauce with garlic and onions. No, no, no, it gives more, it gives more like a sauce, like you take it like mushroom sauce for a sandwich or... We can make it. For the ham, it's good. It's wonderful. Like, you know, it's almost like for a steak, or medallions. They make the pork medallions. Yeah, small, different. Sure. If you want to do, I think we can do it. Yeah, but this is, I mean, this is not, it's not hard to turn this into something edible. It's really interesting. Okay, what are the things that we have left and I mean this is the this is what annoys me, right?

You know what's the issue? Apparently, many of these suites that were closer really towards the expedition area. And the fridge was bad. Right. So no chance. Well figured out. Shall we do the we do it? Yes. At what time do we start? For the half, probably soonish because that's going to take a while. Two hours I think is going to be. At least. Because those ovens. Yeah, depends what oven you want. No, no, no. One is good. I know which one is good. So on the right side. You probably need to use one of the larger ones. On the right side. The lower one.
