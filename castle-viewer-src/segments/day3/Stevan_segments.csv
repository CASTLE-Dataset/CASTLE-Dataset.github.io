But that was the image, you know, like, oh my God, this kind of surveillance societies, blah, blah, blah. Okay. So now you come to the West. honestly do you also feel like we are having now discussion about regular stuff that we do, that we say nobody is doing something offensive as in, I have no idea, planning criminal deeds or whatever. No, no, but seriously. Like we are seriously concerned. We are seriously concerned about what we say. Yes, we are. It's insane, isn't it? How is that different? We have a verbal delict. So one of the things that philosophers of the West really saw as a major difference between West and East was verbal delict. You can suffer consequences for non-criminal speech. What? We are talking here about consequences for non-criminal speech is true but we are not talking about criminal speech we are not talking about criminal speech so basically I'm excluding that nobody is planning terrorist attacks nobody Nobody's planning.

Somebody says something, as soon as it's opposing view of any sort. Ah, guys, how was the very yesterday? We changed the topic, you know, like, there are really taboo topics you don't wanna discuss with colleagues anymore. That's like, what is going on here? That's true. What was the general assumption that you have the right not to be offended, which is nonsense, but there's increasingly many and increasingly loud people who are defending their right not to be offended. For example, in the US they have the freedom of speech, right? That goes very often in the line of criminal speech. So, Stormfront, if you say neo-Nazi website, is allowed there in Florida, for example. I mean, we have freedom of expression, which is for all practical purposes the same thing. The freedom of speech thing they have in the US is a bit more narrowly defined and a bit more short-sighted. But essentially this is a legal construct, not a societal construct. Right? Right, that's true. The mob can still come after you. Yeah, and the media. If they don't like it. Yes, the people with influence can still come after you and tell everybody what a horrible person you are for something you allegedly said. And we made this, we just accept this, right? We just accept this. This has been done so often and so casually that this has just come to places. And you just accept that, oh yeah, somebody said something horrible. Somebody posted something horrible on Twitter, right? And then if you were actually to go and check, then you would see that in most cases it was taken out of context, or they didn't actually say this, or it was meant as, in my way, sarcastically or something, right? It usually wasn't the thing that people then claim happened, but something less interesting. But if it were less interesting, then people wouldn't be interested, right? This is a consequence of the attention economy. Outrage sells. So the more outrage you can generate... It's all about virtue signaling. I mean, people exaggerate that it was really so bad in socialism. I think Yugoslavia was, I think, having flaws, but it was functioning state, you know what I mean?

I'm not saying about this one. I'm saying in general. Like, basically, I noticed people, we start normal discussion about normal societal issues, be it, I don't know, geopolitics or climate change. Somebody says something, as soon as it's opposing view of any sort. Ah, guys, how was the very yesterday? We changed the topic, you know, like, there are really taboo topics you don't wanna discuss with colleagues anymore. That's like, what is going on here? That's true. What was the general assumption that you have the right not to be offended, which is nonsense, but there's increasingly many and increasingly loud people who are defending their right not to be offended. For example, in the US they have the freedom of speech, right? That goes very often in the line of criminal speech. So, Stormfront, if you say neo-Nazi website, is allowed there in Florida, for example. I mean, we have freedom of expression, which is for all practical purposes the same thing. The freedom of speech thing they have in the US is a bit more narrowly defined and a bit more short-sighted. But essentially this is a legal construct, not a societal construct. Right? Right, that's true. The mob can still come after you. Yeah, and the media. If they don't like it. Yes, the people with influence can still come after you and tell everybody what a horrible person you are for something you allegedly said. And we made this, we just accept this, right? We just accept this. This has been done so often and so casually that this has just come to places. And you just accept that, oh yeah, somebody said something horrible. Somebody posted something horrible on Twitter, right? And then if you were actually to go and check, then you would see that in most cases it was taken out of context, or they didn't actually say this, or it was meant as, in my way, sarcastically or something, right? It usually wasn't the thing that people then claim happened, but something less interesting. But if it were less interesting, then people wouldn't be interested, right? This is a consequence of the attention economy. Outrage sells. So the more outrage you can generate... It's all about virtue signaling. I mean, people exaggerate that it was really so bad in socialism. I think Yugoslavia was, I think, having flaws, but it was functioning state, you know what I mean? And one thing that I've only found funny there is that literally those aspects that people saw as extremely bad, we accept as totally normal in the West I'm like"

And Klaus also, you know, like we cut hair and everything. So now you got, meaning I don't have any hair, yeah, like pretty much buzz cut. But in general, people have hairstyles that they kind of care about. So we kind of removed that portion totally. And now for, I don't know how much influence it has, and this is for something else.

And then we continue with the smoked salmon yes so which one is that so so no no what are you ordering is it here here just here we're gonna this is gonna be chicken goujons ah because think about the poor man hasn't cooked food in months he's now having to cook food start up the kitchen for the first time cook food for us he doesn't want us to have five different types of starter. It just isn't a restaurant. You're just assuming. He's actually been very nice to even open the food for us in the first place. Okay, good one. Chicken goujons. Easier to eat. Chicken goujons. Now, dessert. No bones. We have three choices. Let's try to minimize the choices for him, right? Just ice cream. Do we apple pie and strawberries and cream it's not strawberry season right that's really something so it is frozen strawberry apple pie or ice cream i want apple pie i want ice cream okay no you can put ice cream on top of apple pie. Yeah, you can do that. Why don't we do apple pie with ice cream? Let's do it. Starter, basically. We just do ice cream, dad. Maybe we go for the apple pie and ice cream. I don't want any of it. It's too much. So, why an apple pie? After an Irish breakfast tomorrow, followed by big lasagna followed by smoked salmon followed by chicken goujons and large steak probably apple pie it's gonna be too much probably then but maybe we don't need starter even so basically we either take starter just get a plate of chicken chicken goujons we can share only one one, yeah, I mean. One plate. One plate, okay."

"Based on the visual cues in the image, I can classify this segment as **Setting Table**.

Here's why:

*   **Kitchen environment:** The presence of a refrigerator, cabinetry, and what appears to be a doorway suggests a kitchen or dining area.
*   **Item on the refrigerator:** There are papers and possibly magnets on the refrigerator. This is a common place to keep reminders or schedules, which could be related to meal preparation or setting the table.
*   **Partially visible wooden item:** The large wooden item leaning against the wall might be part of a table or a piece of furniture being moved into place.
*   **General context:** While not definitively clear, the overall scene suggests a domestic setting where activities like preparing for a meal or tidying up are occurring.

While other categories might seem plausible in a kitchen, ""Setting Table"" best fits the collection of subtle clues. It implies an action related to preparing for a meal or gathering.",654,655," okay i shall go bake this order what time should we start the workshop at? Is that 10.30? It's okay.

"The image shows a kitchen scene. There is a clock on the wall, a list on the refrigerator, a toaster, and various food items. The presence of a toaster and food items suggests that cooking or preparing food is likely occurring or has occurred. Therefore, the most fitting category would be Cooking.

However, without seeing any specific actions related to cooking, it's difficult to definitively classify. If the context is about preparing food, then ""Cooking"" is appropriate. If it's simply a kitchen environment with food items present, other categories might also be considered depending on the implied activity.

Given the provided options, and the visual cues of a kitchen with food, the most general and likely activity associated with this scene is **Cooking**.",793,794," okay i shall go bake this order what time should we start the workshop at?

Automatic, asynchronous. Yeah, it's directly to the loud post. Just to specify it. Yeah, exactly. So why not? Okay, so interactive happens at the competition. Queries, everything is at the competition. It's typical VBS stuff. Queries are going to be RedHawk and Q&A. We can't even do instant search. Can we do, just if I may ask, because that's kind of a huge trend in the community that we probably shouldn't ignore and we are almost there. Just kind of try to go just a little bit one step extra with the known item search to kind of formulate it more as a conversational task. It is already there, so it would just take revealing partially more and more information. Can you give an example? For an example, like what I'm doing with Evangelos, for example, Kanoulas, that's a colleague from information retrieval and this is like mostly text now, but we are trying kind of to do the visual and with the Hongi and it's, we said there, Evangelos and I were thinking what are the good benchmarks for this kind of task, multimodal conversational search and you know, I told him VBS and LiveLook search, that's as close as it gets. It doesn't exist. There are data sets, few data sets here and there. So just to give you an example. So for example, when you normally start revealing, maybe we didn't think that way, but I talked to Cajal several times about it. You say, for example, aha, I'm looking for a video. Cajal says, for example, let's go first LSE and I'll give you VBS, the same example, it's almost a conversation. So Cajal says, our anonymous life logger was sitting in a chair, it was a home of a family member and I was looking at something on a wall. And then people are looking for many things which are correct and not correct that's literally like what you do in the first round of interaction in first turn of interaction conversational systems and there comes additional part of information that we sometimes keep as a ground truth like as a part of information need that you're not aware of in conversational systems. Then you say, oh, it was a painting and there was something white and red on it. It's kind of giving you extra so there is user interacting. Then comes, oh, those were the figures. It could be aliens or it could be some tribal information. So we do this, yeah. So that's like people are developing conversational system. Okay, we're there already. We're there already. Yeah, that's what I said. Yes. But some queries are not like that. I was just like say when we select the queries actually to be queries that are also compatible with this conversational. All the item search queries are like that? The LSC no item search queries are all like that. Then it's okay. Sometimes they are. They're okay then. Ad hoc, find as many as we can. Yes. Fewer stages. Instant search, find a single one. Not all of them are, but we should just kind of think all queries. Can an item search, not AVS, but because that you can specify precisely, but all known item search queries are. Yeah, but that's already maybe we just kind of then formulated slightly when advertising. But then this means we would go for known item search and not for ad hoc, right? Yes, this is known item search. This is known item search. Yes, yes. Yes, totally, totally. We were discussing, but at some point you were not really persuaded that it's already conversational. So what were your reasons? It's not conversational because conversational search, my understanding is I say something to the system, system has a question, but I say something else and there's this conversation. But it's compatible with conversational, yeah. The other, the other, the way... It's pseudo conversational search. What way conversational search? It depends what kind of system people develop and we could advertise. Hey, this is... No, you can't because the query is fixed. So if I ask you not what was on the picture, but if I ask you what color has the frame... Yeah, yeah, totally, totally. But these are really clarifying kind of of further that's often what they call conversational search in this fashion type of things or how this would work is evangelist runs this as a workshop at ecr in 2026. what do you think evangelist and you run this as a workshop at ecr to build conversational search engines for lifelong data but how is this when did he run it no he should he should oh yeah totally but how is this a conversation if there's only one party to the conversation and the you have an agent so how i see it but maybe it's wrong we've been developing this kind of for very long meaning when you started in 2006 2006-2007, you would be doing Rockio and so on. We couldn't do better. You know what I mean? But that was already this primitive conversation with a system. System gives you something, you label something as positive and negative, and then you go back and so on. So you are conversing in a system in a very primitive way. But the queries are fixed. They're just revealed over time. The conversation would be, I give you some high-level information and then you can ask for more. You're out. We have more SD cards. I changed mine. Luca, you're a smart person. So does that mean we don't go by the data? Sometimes, not always. I think that's a different challenge. Yeah, I mean what you could do is, but this is a different... Turn it off first before you take out your sticker, please. What you could do is like rather than prepare these list of hints, prepare like one page description of the scene you're looking for with a lot of detail and then you could have this as an oracle that people ask against this is so complicated to do it's not enough to do yeah because we would run that oracle service somewhere and i i really kind of think because um you know why we shouldn't overthink it it's an ECR challenge It's ECR challenge And the other thing is of course who I mean if you do that based on an LLM you couldn't ensure that the answers are exactly reproducible Let's do that with Evangelou But this is essentially something that we use a data set to do these things. Go to CGR, go to ICR, I'm sure they would like it."
Talking,3280,3281," beforehand and then they need to to send it okay time to show i describe and teams can this is more or less shouting what was this what was that essentially have an ad of a conversation for for a vbs style um setting this could work. Yeah. For something like this... We could also do it here for the interactive part. We could also do it here. I'm a bit... In the first year, which we know works. Yes, I'm a bit more hesitant for this because for... If you do for something like v3c the possible universe of of things is so much larger that it's probably questions that are much more easy to answer quickly whereas we do it if somebody goes how exactly was this and then the person no no but that's a good answer this because there's a conversational challenge rather than a retrieval challenge. Can I just kind of try to explain because I don't know how much I should say because we didn't finish. We just started working with Hongi, I can say about it. Hongi, my PhD with Evangelos, what we started doing. Why I see it's actually conversation. Can I? No, yes. But it's kind of in development stage, you know, like, so I'm not sure that it works. So I don't like, but so basically this is the general idea. When you formulate information need, and I think that's what you did well with VBS and LSE. When you kind of get an information need, you're often not able to formulate it clearly, or unwilling, or so. You want to use as short query as possible and get the relevant result. So we are now developing some agents on both sides, on retrieval and for information need and so on, to handle those sites. But actually, what we have here is like really user that has information need, but is either unwilling or unable to clearly formulate it as a very concise and detailed query. So the system then retrieves something. And these clarifying information that came later on are there because nobody found relevant results. So I think this is really good simulation of that information need and conversing. Oh, it's not that when you provide additional information, hey, just to help you, it's still not that. I mean this. So at least I see it already as conversation because you are revealing increasingly more and more specific information need. But when you say oh it's not that you're seeing something every system returned back to you so it's kind of two-way already now we have a lot of teams how do we handle it we are already doing it because when yeah but that's I think why we argue it's probably not conversational because it's one way You you kind of assume what the next question will be and you are you answer that one, right? How many you assume that they get you because this one was showing something One way communication, huh? Because we have the hints that give you yeah, we don't have you can't ask for anything else We presume this will be the next thing you ask about and that's the information we give you yeah but any benchmark that you make it up to this point i i kind of argue like up to this point where we stand we cannot really make totally open-ended actually conversation what lucas says if it's an interactive and it's the same for all the teams there we can do it yeah what Stefan is saying is in the IR community now I'm not really in it anymore so I don't know but they do simulate the conversational queries by that kind of an approach and we just work with a simulation I think for a CIR mm-hmm yes be it are automatic or interactive and each day are probably needs an interactive challenge at a workshop because it doesn't do that. It's not the most exciting conference I've ever been to. ECR? I met you there 2010. In Dublin. Milton Keynes of all places. Oh, yeah, went to Bletchley Park. The only monument of any significance in that city is a cow in the middle of the city. Yes, I remember that. Okay. Myself and Udo. And Susan. Susan, yes, little, yes. Okay, so... We're going to end our conversation. I was just like saying how to actually market it to the community because I don't think lots of people actually realize that this is like previous generation of, you know, what became conversations. Okay. But then the conclusion would be if we want to do that, then we should go with non-item search queries rather than ad hoc queries. We could have ad hoc as well, but... Well, the question is how many query times because I would for sure do Q&A because I think that's the most exciting thing to do on that type of data. Then non-item search and Q&A. Do we need ad hoc? I think we want ad hoc if you want that kind of the pseudo conversational... No. No. No, because ad hoc is... Because ad hoc is... I'm wrong, for instance. Do we care about ad hoc every example of... It depends on the use case. Ad hoc is anyway hard to judge, right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally. Let's dump ad hoc and see how it goes.

If you do for something like v3c the possible universe of of things is so much larger that it's probably questions that are much more easy to answer quickly whereas we do it if somebody goes how exactly was this and then the person no no but that's a good answer this because there's a conversational challenge rather than a retrieval challenge. Can I just kind of try to explain because I don't know how much I should say because we didn't finish. We just started working with Hongi, I can say about it. Hongi, my PhD with Evangelos, what we started doing. Why I see it's actually conversation. Can I? No, yes. But it's kind of in development stage, you know, like, so I'm not sure that it works. So I don't like, but so basically this is the general idea. When you formulate information need, and I think that's what you did well with VBS and LSE. When you kind of get an information need, you're often not able to formulate it clearly, or unwilling, or so. You want to use as short query as possible and get the relevant result. So we are now developing some agents on both sides, on retrieval and for information need and so on, to handle those sites. But actually, what we have here is like really user that has information need, but is either unwilling or unable to clearly formulate it as a very concise and detailed query. So the system then retrieves something. And these clarifying information that came later on are there because nobody found relevant results. So I think this is really good simulation of that information need and conversing. Oh, it's not that when you provide additional information, hey, just to help you, it's still not that. I mean this. So at least I see it already as conversation because you are revealing increasingly more and more specific information need. But when you say oh it's not that you're seeing something every system returned back to you so it's kind of two-way already now we have a lot of teams how do we handle it we are already doing it because when yeah but that's I think why we argue it's probably not conversational because it's one way You you kind of assume what the next question will be and you are you answer that one, right? How many you assume that they get you because this one was showing something One way communication, huh? Because we have the hints that give you yeah, we don't have you can't ask for anything else We presume this will be the next thing you ask about and that's the information we give you yeah but any benchmark that you make it up to this point i i kind of argue like up to this point where we stand we cannot really make totally open-ended actually conversation what lucas says if it's an interactive and it's the same for all the teams there we can do it yeah what Stefan is saying is in the IR community now I'm not really in it anymore so I don't know but they do simulate the conversational queries by that kind of an approach and we just work with a simulation I think for a CIR mm-hmm yes be it are automatic or interactive and each day are probably needs an interactive challenge at a workshop because it doesn't do that. It's not the most exciting conference I've ever been to. ECR? I met you there 2010. In Dublin. Milton Keynes of all places. Oh, yeah, went to Bletchley Park. The only monument of any significance in that city is a cow in the middle of the city. Yes, I remember that. Okay. Myself and Udo. And Susan. Susan, yes, little, yes. Okay, so... We're going to end our conversation. I was just like saying how to actually market it to the community because I don't think lots of people actually realize that this is like previous generation of, you know, what became conversations. Okay. But then the conclusion would be if we want to do that, then we should go with non-item search queries rather than ad hoc queries. We could have ad hoc as well, but... Well, the question is how many query times because I would for sure do Q&A because I think that's the most exciting thing to do on that type of data. Then non-item search and Q&A. Do we need ad hoc? I think we want ad hoc if you want that kind of the pseudo conversational... No. No. No, because ad hoc is... Because ad hoc is... I'm wrong, for instance. Do we care about ad hoc every example of... It depends on the use case. Ad hoc is anyway hard to judge, right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally. Let's dump ad hoc and see how it goes. AdHoc would require either people defining specific segments."
