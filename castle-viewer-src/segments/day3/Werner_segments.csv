But if I do that, I basically get the point, unless he can trap. Should I go against him? Yes. Exactly. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Now I'll do something different. 10. So that's 10 in Roman letters. Even though I could exchange this. Because you're going to try to draw it also. What is that now? Maybe. No, it's just other symbols. I mean, the heart is the same as the other, but the other symbols are different. Oh, but yes. Okay. All right. This is unter. Unter. Okay. 11 points. Alright. You're very competitive.

Potentially we'll have to do a clean-out. Of that minute where they're going to have to disappear. Ten is the highest one? Ace is the highest one. Ten after that? No, ten is the lowest one. No, those are four three two. The king, queen, king, queen. Okay. This is a ten. And this is what? This is why they're cooking. Okay. Yeah, but this is the ace color. It was Lando. Yeah. All right.

I think this will...this was on the first day. I have the answer. I had a little retrieved. I just found it. I think we need to make an acronym that That spells out Poirot or something like this. That's a great cheese. Good one? Oh yes it is. Magnificent. Fully agree. Let's find out if this caragoline playing itself is good. Nobody tried the French Emmental. If you want to investigate... No, I do not want to. On a point of principle? I'm disturbed by its very existence. Where is it from originally? The Emmental. Well, I mean, this one one isn't this one is probably from france"

Can just uh show the other one so do we uh so there's another one now uh is the really point to win that or just to have enjoyable experience for everybody i think uh probably second one is more important and i think many people would like to try those systems if people come there imagine seniors from our community they are be, oh, they want to sit there and try and students probably, what is this thing?

But what if the plan of that is there is the expert session in the actual challenge session, but there is part of the demo session where all the systems participating are there, or like a specific area. I wouldn't see training necessarily as a competition. I would suggest just having sort of an open demo where people can try out the systems. But not just like interspersed somewhere but a specific area of the demo which is the LifeLog challenge. I believe with the experts there to explain the systems. But what I believe, what I think actually it's really fun also for novices that join there, colleagues, audience, you see why this is very interesting, I think I noticed first time that kind of effect in Iceland in 2017. Jan Soborov came from NIST, and I don't think he's seen this for a while. I think he was involved from early track weeks and Kiss Task was there. So he was really, oh my God, I think we should make all benchmarks like this, you know, like this is like Olympics, you know, but only for nerds, you know, and it was like, well, you remember, like, you remember. Yes, but tracks does not. SIG-MM does still not do that. Yeah. And I mean, he's still running track, so he could have if he wanted to. The reason we're still here is because SIG-MM want to replicate V lsc and ac and multimedia so they want that right thing totally right so we still have to put on that thing only fancy thing right and that's enough right yeah yeah but it it has it has to be zero stakes yeah yes because if if you if you stake anything if you oh, this is the proper competition at the flagship conference,"
Leisure Activities,548,623," I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm a bottle of whiskey every round. There's the small ones. What's the budget of this? A bottle of whiskey every round? No, our idea here, right, you get to get people enthused. Yes, yes, yes. It's fun. It's totally fun. At the right part of the conference, it exists where everybody is going to be. So you know what you can do? I did it for my students. You buy a bottle of wine and you buy chocolates. And then you ask them, you know, somebody doesn't drink, somebody like, hey guys, the first one can choose, you know, like Moldovan wine, Georgian wine or Italian plus there are chocolates, you know. You choose what he wants. Yeah, right, right. And then hopefully by the next year, we have more people to take part. So one thing you could do is if you start with a preparation session where people just practice, then this happens, you could even do the novice session at the welcome reception. After that, there's the competition. Yeah, right. By that time, that gives you pressure to debug things you have some practice you get to see the some types of tasks you have to make create more tasks that's the disadvantage but uh otherwise you could recycle them yeah uh but that might bring people if they have seen this at the reception to promise and the following year the day set remains the same for the second year and maybe provide some baseline retrieval system that people use yeah to make it easier by the way i want to do this yourself there's an api i mean there's systems out there right yeah there's at least half a dozen things that have been participating yeah in vbs lsc that you can get from the top if anyone would ever bother them. To make it easier, basically you would give them like a prepared data set for that system so that this is ready to use and it should be made as easy as possible. Okay, have we decided? Not sure. No. I personally would rather do expert session and then let everybody try. Yeah don't we do the expert session in the workshop? Expert session takes place in the workshop. Wait a second, you talk workshop, grand challenge and hackathon. We're in charge. The way to get this to work is we make it. But the grand challenge can't be a competition with the experts. The grand challenge has got to be asynchronous and asynchronous. We will stay talking about asynchronous. The Grand Challenge should also have the classical Grand Challenge aspects, as in you actually get to present your stuff with at least a poster, and there's a leaderboard, and blah, blah, blah. All of this is happening beforehand. With the Grand Challenge, there is a workshop that takes place before the Grand Challenge where you actually come and use your practices. By workshop, do you mean an actual co-located thing that happens in the workshop slot, or you mean a session? It's up to us. Yeah, but in the workshop slot It changes the logistics dramatically. Because those are fundamentally from a proceedings point of view, from a conference setup point of view, those are two different things. In the workshop it doesn't have proceedings. It's just an event. I don't know. But I mean you're really talking about an extended conference session, right? Yes. But that's not. So it's kind of two sessions to the... But the grand challenge track will have multiple grand challenges, right? Yes. This is something that we'll need. This is one of the grand challenges. Yes, this is one of the grand challenges. Actually, it's different for everybody else. But we'll presume... Well, that's the question, right? Is the grand challenge part different to everybody else or is it just, oh, by the way, there's there's this second half to the event that is not technically part of the grand challenge but is another thing that happens interactively? Let me turn a question around and say let's say we get three grand challenges and two are conventional one is conversational search requires an interactive element we accept it mm-hmm we don't say no. So grand challenges, if you look at the multimedia grand challenges, there is this longest running one, I don't know how they call it, social media prediction or something like that. It started with a...is it JD.com? I don't know who sponsored it. There is even significant money involved there. And there are teams, does anybody know that one? It's pretty large at Insti Multimedia and it's been running for like maybe, I will say five to ten years already. And they always have two, three, like they have a leaderboard somehow beforehand, you know, so it's asynchronous. But also they have different ones. One is like social media prediction, that's like something like about popularity of the media, like mostly marketing type of task, you know, and the other one is, I don't know, something, but they clearly have separate kind of scoring mechanisms and so on and so on. Can you check how many grand challenge is there by the way? Something in the order of 10-ish i mean the typical grand challenge is asynchronous right yeah where you do all the evaluation in the trance just like kakko 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12. Yeah, that's if you try to make the interactive part during the grand challenge track of the conference, it has two disadvantages. I think in the sense that you don't treat the challenges in the same way how you allocate the time budget that's one thing and the other thing is as you said you want to present leaderboard or results you don't know that or just know it five minutes before so if you do that in a workshop session before then you could have these things and maybe you do I don't"

There might be a non-archival workshop that happens on the day before to actually do the interactive part of the experiment. And there is a sub-session in the demo track that has the things and just opens this up to everybody. And then it fits neatly in all the categories the conference has anyway. I mean, yeah, with a bit of, but we can do that. But at least it doesn't introduce something fundamentally new, so if somebody wants to do this next year or the year after or whenever, it doesn't completely break. And if we want asynchronous, we need to have an associated workshop. That's part of the proposal. Also for synchronous. Well, it's not. It doesn't even necessarily need to be a proper workshop. Like you won't have the goals. Yeah. It's still part of the grand challenge. We just essentially need to have a room booked during the workshop part of the conference. So it doesn't interfere with... I think using the word workshop is probably... we need to find another word. Yeah, I mean, it's the interactive session of the challenge. LSC is a workshop. Yeah, it's only a workshop.

Yeah I think so. So it's just a demo session. A demo session but the competition... The challenge session of course as well. And then you just have a... The challenge session is the one that happens like two months early. For example. No, no, no. At the conference there's still the challenge session. Just a regular Grand Challenge session that presents the results and you discuss... Not an actual competition that's taking place in the Grand Challenge. No. That's happened in September. There's a... probably before that, because people will need to submit their papers, so this is a summary. The time frame isn't great. No, the time frame isn't great, but we need sleep, right?

So what do we do? One thing that I figured out from the discussion is that they I Don't know if we can deliver that but I really wanted Things to be more interactive engaging It still can be interactive And engaging would be the demo session Can you say demo? so there is a demo session at the moment. Do you want a separate demo session or within the grandstand? No, within the regular demo session. Logistics to be determined. But then we have to really then synchronize with the demo chairs because you know lots of demos were rejected actually. This year they rejected like three yeah but we can reserve that slot but demos this year was was somehow say oh pending that you are accepted as a demo no no no they don't need to be accepted no this is they get the free slot in the demo program and the demo chairs will have to deal with it.

Ninson Dyer understands. Who's the other person? I don't know. I think only two. Yeah, I'm trying to check.

I'm happy that that we've done enough we can we can summarize this again make sure everybody's on the same page. There were more things on the agenda but you're whatever. Hackathon? Tell us tell us.

They do take-outs for the rest of the group. I mean, ideally there would just be more people and then you would have fewer people in there. You would have a smaller fraction of people involved. More people. But then the cooking organization is going to be messy. No, because then you would have people who are explicitly in charge of things which we did not have. Oh yeah, everybody does something. The people who do the shopping and the people who actually do the cooking are not the same people. Information gets lost along the way and nobody knows what's going on. I think we did a good job, right? We got almost everything we needed. We got almost everything right. I think we did well with what we had, but it could have been streamlined. I would argue the whole thing was well done, but there's a comma in there. I would say very well. People didn't get the joke. I got it. It's okay. Just as an example, how do we do it on a boat? Very light breakfast, in a sense, spreads cheese. We could do a lighter breakfast on Irish breakfast. Then lunch is really cooking. Evenings we always do in a restaurant. If we had gone to a restaurant... You are aware that this is not a boat. This has different boundary conditions. The challenge is, if we had gone to a restaurant every night, we would have added an extra 3,000 or 4,000 euros to the cost. Yeah, no, no. We't do it on our own on our own budget yeah yeah i mean the other logistics here is there is no restaurant nearby that's open every night right so that's it that's why we chose this because it was so far from there there's nowhere to go all right well there is another i mean another option this is you know basically if it's possible to add a couple of people who do some of the the cooking just to the corner yes so that would be one of them Ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthvað annar, ég finn ekki eitthva Absolutely. You do not want the disagreements as part of it as all part of the data set. Totally. Yeah. The thing is that just the whole everybody does everything somehow and nobody's responsible for anything and nobody's in charge and nobody knows what's going on because everybody does everything. If we had Alice here, we'd all be on time, right? We need Alice. Possibly going around we just need get over there yeah so basically you're saying yeah so that's actually a point you need the manager essentially who is not yes taking taking care of of of the logistics of the details of of all the goings-on you need a j to organize in advance, you need an Alice to organize when we're here. Or something that floats over. But also that's maybe slightly less emphasis on cooking and then some better organization. So that's a couple of points. And what about technical aspects? But actually from now maybe the hardware could be... This wasn't too bad, right? It's not too bad. Actually, I thought it would be worse. It's worked really well. In the middle of the day my head was hurting quite a bit, but it's getting better. That was something else. That was the second bit of shit. Yeah, well, I think it's a bit of a pressure cooker. It's decent, it's not great. I have no complaints. If we were stuck with what we all happen to have in a closet in DC, if ACM gave us 20,000 next time or 30,000, for sure we'd do something much nicer. We made it work. 40,000, 50,000. Just one comment about what Björn said about the cooking. I think it's a good idea to have dedicated people cooking, but after thinking about it, I think it's very nice that we had here so many different dishes done by different people, and we could look up them later on. And also it's a lot about life right yes yeah absolutely so improvisations i would clearly vote against like the catering aspect of it yeah um but but it needs in general i mean we we had very little in terms of an agenda which in in some aspects is going to give people for the freedom to do, there needs to be more agenda, like in general. And people behind the scenes making sure that the agenda can actually happen. Because now everybody who runs around doing things is also... So there's no behind the scenes support. You need a production crew."
Serving Drink,2110,2117," Yes, essentially. For a lot of things, also for various setup-y things, that just takes time and resources that we did not really have this time around. So essentially, if there were the option to do this with a larger crowd of people in a larger location it would probably make sense to... Are you thinking, go back to the schedule we had from three months ago we didn't implement? That was everything was half an hour blocks. For this half an hour you're planning to. Maybe half an hour is too much. It doesn't need to be half an hour blocks, but essentially really clear and strict assignments as in, look, we have a workshop part. This is this time window. We have lunch. Lunch always happens at this time, which necessitates this time block before. And it's those people, those really know what they're going to have. Everything, there's just like checklists and stuff. This time is dinner, this necessitates this, this, this, this. We're not that far off. But it wasn't really implemented like this because it's, oh yeah, but let's do this at our age. Oh no, let's swap these two things. Oh no, let's do this. That is actually okay because we are still having our... Life is also chaotic sometimes, right? Yeah, but this is not supposed to be like that. This is supposed to work. If we had had an Alice equivalent here with a checkbox saying, okay, you have to do the cook now, it's time to cook to cook that would have been okay it also means if you had somebody who could basically run up to the store or drive off to the store yes so some daily some fixers essentially daily basically so what do we need for tomorrow like if one of us had been a one of us three had been a helper or not yes this was fine it's not much but it's really there is somebody It was not.

Essentially, it needs a production crew. It needs a director behind the scenes who's actually on top of everything. And basically has authority over the participants. Yes. I think that's kind of the... When you're taking part in experiments and having authority, it's a problem. And also, if there's no clear schedule, it is also difficult to coordinate things because then it's like, oh, I need to take care of my email. I might as well do this now because nothing's going on. Right. And then people disappear at random points in time because there's no coordination between them. And also if you say, oh, but now we could do this. And then, oh, but three people are missing. Okay. Now then we can't. It just spirals, right?"

Making Coffee,2577,2667," It's really more of, okay, can we throw more activities at the thing to make it more interesting, to make it more interesting. We showed them a laptop we talked about it we got some but we never says it up right yes also I mean the weather was not cooperating so so there wasn't a lot of chance to do outdoorsy things. This is just, well, a house next time with a bigger garden where we can actually do things outside. A treadmill to exercise so that people can be sane. Sanity is overrated. The reason why we're here is because this was the only house we could afford. We'll fix that part. I could have got you a castle, you would have had to pay for your own flights and everything else. It's different. It's different, right? Yeah. We would have spent over 10,000 on this. Despite all the things that you mentioned, I think you've done incredibly well so far. So far so good. Nothing is on fire. Nobody in our community has tried to do this before. I don't know if you've ever seen this. They've taken this completely ten years ago. They put some cameras up in a house and people went in and did some ADLs for a week out. This is far in excess of what that was. Speaking of food, I think I have to go to... I checked the potatoes over there, there were still rocks on it. You have to increase your step count. Let me say, ha ha ha. This is one aspect. The other aspect was, okay, we have the sensors we could get on short notice, mostly because you happen to have them lying around. This, again, it worked. So, of course, we ran into some minor technical issues for various weird reasons. But this is certainly not the best setup to do this sort of thing, right? So I guess what, and this is not necessarily something we absolutely need to collect now, but maybe something to think about, assuming infinite time and infinite budget, what would be the thing we actually wanted to do? Because then we can go down from, okay, what if this is actually feasible to do? So, there's a question, what if the price of admission, let's say, had been to buy some kind of equipment? Everything is paid for except you need to bring your own set of goggles or whatever. Would people run into trouble with be there okay you have to check how you like them yes sir it's probably it's not sure there's a different problem it's probably fine no it's probably fine right yeah somehow it's a community of people right and here everybody trusts everybody in this room. And that's even fundamentally what we need to have to get this to work. If it was a 500 euro entrance fee, and you got to keep your hardware afterwards, I wouldn't have any problem doing that. No. And I think probably it's easier than paying for the travel, because it's easier to squeeze in some hardware budget somewhere than having like official requests for travel and things like that. So if there is a thing out there you can buy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. If we need to make ivory ourselves, it might be much more. That's what we're going to get at the moment. Yeah, it's just something to keep in mind. So that if there is something that we desire, you know. Look at the challenges we have with this. Battery life, we went through numerous different options for batteries. I have 36 GoPro batteries in DCU. We bought double of everything, right? More. We even tried AA battery packs wired through a voltage regulator directly into it. We had to go with this approach. Then they were overheating. We even tried fans inside. There was a huge amount of effort to get to what actually you're wearing right now, which actually actually works so even if we did this again in 18 months time there's probably nothing better than this still that we can actually do now there's only i decided to look already a very small thing which would be like a belt clip for the power pack which is probably more more convenient they were cheap yeah true but a belt clip is probably not so expensive either. They're also not using like... But look, that's milk-holate. Yeah, I have a space in my pocket. But I mean, this is still assuming that this needs to be done on shortish notice with off-the-shelf hardware. Yeah. So assuming this was not a requirement."

You have to shave your head before coming. BCI is actually on the list. BCI is definitely on the list. We could do part of the BCIs. No problem. No problem is... well there's a whole cascade of problems. But we could probably make it work. We could put a BCI cap on everybody in the morning time.

Just every day for a reading task. There's a demo where they say, you know, you can't is very important. Just every day for a reading task. There's a demo at ICM Multimedia. What is the research question? For the eye tracking? The research question here is we had to use it because we brought the hardware here. You know what's also cool?

So that's another thing to think about if we kind of make ourselves relevant to them. So what do we say to somebody who says I'd like to run this experiment myself? Be careful what you do. Does anybody think we shouldn't have done it? No. No, I think it's great. I would do it again. I would do it again. We could do it again. We still have one more day. I'm assuming that we will end up doing this again at some point in 18 months or 24 months down the line. Somewhere. It doesn to be here it can be anywhere i prefer 18 over 24 because that would land in summertime or 20 or 30. it doubles the price or 30 right yeah also fine this is 3 000 euros for a week it's five or six thousand in the summertime right but it gives you the outdoors look next time we go back to acm we're asking for 20 25 000. ask for more they're going to scope it down yeah we asked for 35 we got 10 or something well yeah but i mean there is a chance i would say that this is if this is successful then it's like we certainly have the right to go back yeah Yeah, that's one of your grand mix tips. Onko mahdollisuus sanoa, että jos tämä on kuitenkin onnistunut, niin on mahdollisuus saada lisää tuhoa. Luulen, että olemme tehneet paljon 10 000 euroa.

But for real this time. Oh no, no, no, lunch. Lunch, I will make lunch. Breakfast at 8. No, breakfast, okay, light breakfast at 9. That doesn't require any cooking because we don't have anything left to cook. We have plenty of cheese. We have plenty of bread. We have butter. We have cornflakes. We even have oats for those who want to make themselves. I don't know what this is, but it's got cakey things. How long everyone has their own breakfast in any place and being here? We have nine workshop. So the lasagna, basically the second hour of preparation is inside the oven. So that's workshop time. I really yeah exactly so I guess originally the idea was to prepare the lasagna today. But I finished the oven here. But we could basically, I mean, can it be prepared in parallel to breakfast? I think we're doing the workshop at 10. You mean it's after breakfast? I would also like to have breakfast and then I can do it. We just throw a yes. We just throw a bunch of people at it, we finish it in half an hour. I can help tomorrow. That would be helpful. No breakfast and a brunch which is lasagne. And somebody wants to get food at home at 9 o'clock, there's plenty of food in there. That is an alternative. There is the pressure on me. So if you have lunch at 11, you have to cook that, right? Followed by the workshop. Yeah, I guess it makes sense when you go early already to the salmon. Okay. We start preparing the lasagne maybe already at 8. Yeah, fine. And we can snack while you do this. And we can have some cornflakes. Uncooked pasta and I guess... Crunchy. Instead of cornflakes you take uncooked pasta and put milk on it. And then we're back not too late tomorrow night because someone like Klaus has to leave at 5am. Well we'll see tomorrow what the weather forecast says... The weather forecast is what I read earlier on. Yeah, I mean... 110 km from our winds, sea breaching the coast, flooding, storm, downing or whatever it's called. That's Friday or Saturday?

This is an official civil defense film produced in cooperation with the Federal Civil Defense Administration and in consultation with the Safety Commission of the National Education Association. Produced by Archer Productions, Incorporated. Hey, Bert, come on out and meet all these nice people, please. Oh, all right. We really can't blame you. You see, Bert is a very, very careful fellow. When there's danger, this is the way he keeps from being hurt. Sometimes it even saves his life. That's why these children are practicing to duck and cover, just as you do in your school. We all know the atomic bomb is very dangerous. Since it may be used against us, we must get ready for it, just as we are ready for many other dangers that are around us all the time. Fire is a danger. It can burn whole buildings if someone is careless. But we are ready for fires. We have a fine fire department to put out the fire, and you have fire drills in your school so you know what to do. Automobiles can be dangerous too. They sometimes cause bad accidents, but we are ready. We have safety rules that car drivers and people who are walking must obey. Now, we must be ready for a new danger, the atomic bomb. First, you have to know what happens when an atomic bomb explodes. You will know when it comes. We hope it never comes, but we must be ready. It looks something like this. There is a bright flash, brighter than the sun,"

No matter where we live, in the city or the country, we must be ready all the time for the atomic bomb. Duck and cover. That's the first thing to do, duck and cover. The next important thing to do after that is to stay covered until the danger is over i guess we must all get ready now so we know how to save ourselves that the atomic bomb ever explodes near us if you do not know just what to do ask your teacher when this film ist over okay this was really used yeah what year was it 1952. so this is now back again the reality yes we.

"The image depicts a person's hand holding a white cabinet door open, revealing the interior. Inside the cabinet, there's a glimpse of what appears to be a stove or oven, with a circular grate visible. There's also some dark-colored material and a metallic object. The context suggests the cabinet might be related to kitchen appliances. None of the provided categories directly fit this scenario. However, if we interpret the presence of the stove/oven and the general kitchen environment as a prelude to meal preparation, ""Cooking"" could be a loosely associated category. Without more information or clearer context, a definitive classification is challenging.

"The image shows a person's hand holding a screwdriver and a part of a cabinet. This action is most likely related to **Moving Furniture** or a general repair/assembly activity. Given the options, ""Moving Furniture"" is the closest fit, as assembling or disassembling furniture often involves screwdrivers.

If the cabinet is being installed, repaired, or modified, it falls under a broader category of ""home improvement"" which is often related to furniture.

However, if the screwdriver is being used to adjust the hinges of the cabinet door, it could also be considered **Maintenance** or **Repair**, which are not explicitly listed.

Let's consider the most direct interpretation: the screwdriver is being used to interact with the cabinet. Without more context, it's hard to be definitive, but ""Moving Furniture"" or a related activity involving tools and furniture is the most plausible.

"The image displays people in a living room setting with a dining table in the background, suggesting a social gathering. The presence of a dining table, chairs, and what appears to be a Christmas tree, along with people interacting, points towards **Leisure Activities**.",463,493,

"The provided images show two people in what appears to be a hallway. They are both wearing head-mounted cameras. The person in the foreground is looking into a mirror and touching their glasses. The person in the background is also looking in the same direction and appears to be engaged in an activity. There is no clear indication of any of the listed categories. However, given the head-mounted cameras and their actions, it's plausible they are recording or participating in a leisure activity.

Without further context or clearer actions, it is difficult to definitively classify this segment. However, if forced to choose from the given categories:

The most fitting category, albeit a broad one, would be **Leisure Activities**. They could be filming a personal project, a vlog, or some form of entertainment.

If the activity is more specific and related to recording, a subcategory of leisure activity might be more appropriate, but that's not an option.

Therefore, based on the visual information: **Leisure Activities**.",495,496,

Gut, Zürich, Genf ist gerade noch die längste Strecke, wo man noch irgendwie theoretisch was findet. Es ist so unsinnig, weil es ist ja nicht nur so, dass es eine direkte Zugverbindung gibt von Zürich Hauptbahnhof nach Genf Bahnhof. Nein, der Zug fährt ja von Flughafen zu Flughafen. Ja, in Genf fahren alle im Flughafen durch. Der Zug, der von Zürich nach Genf fährt, fährt immer zum Flughafen in Zürich. Also es ist... Warum gibt es die Flugverbindung? Aber anscheinend ist genug Bedarf da. Früher sind die auch mal nach Zürich-Basel geflogen. Das ist eine Stunde für den Zug. Ja, Linz-Wien gab es früher, aber seit die Hochgeschwindigkeitsstrecke ist, gibt es das nicht mehr. Vor dem Bau von Linz haben wir es ja noch nicht geschafft, den Flughafen an die Bahn anzubieten. Langsam tut sich da jetzt etwas, es könnte sein, dass es bis 2030 steht. Die sind in Graz noch viel besser. Die neue Hochgeschwindigkeitsstrecke nach Klagenfurt ist unter der Landesstraße, die vor dem Flughafen vorbeiläuft. Und der Tunnel ist breit genug schon, weil man dort einmal eine Haltestelle bauen könnte. Aber es gibt eine Teilorganisation der Bahn, die für Hochgeschwindigkeitsstrecken zuständig ist. Sie sagt, das betrifft uns ja nicht. Das Land sagt, das betrifft uns auch nicht, das ist ja eine Hochgeschwindigkeitsstrecke. Sie haben sich auf die Finanzierung nicht einigen können. Das heißt, wenn die Strecke im Dezember 2025 in Betrieb geht, wird sie zwar unter dem Flughafen durchfahren, aber nicht stehen bleiben. Okay. Ja. Ja. Ich habe noch eine Frage. Ja? Ich habe zufällig ein Desinfektionsspray mitgebracht. Ein Spray nicht? Also so ein Handgel habe ich, ja? So etwas habe ich. Nein, das ist natürlich nicht passend.

Yeah but I guess several people have coffee now maybe we should wait for the mugs as well. Or I don't know. Yeah maybe until we get to the workshop it's too late. Yeah you're right., let's start it. We can see if there are things that are not in use. Yeah, true. We didn't carry six ovens, so I mean, a dishwasher of that size, that doesn't seem like. It's not even the large one, it's the small one. This is also Hotpoint, the brand of the dishwasher, because the fridge over as well. So we shouldn't wonder, it didn't cool if it says Hotpoint. Ah, cool. No, no. Doesn't seem to exist in other places. Oops, there was still coffee inside. Well Bosch is Siemens, Whirlpool, everything. It's one brand these days. Is it? Yeah. There is a company called Bosch Siemens Hausgeräte, which is various brands. I bought this one. That one is selected year for year as the best dish washer in the Nordic somehow by consumers. Yeah, fine."

Yeah, it's directly with the loudspeaker. You just need to specify it. Yeah, exactly. So why not? Okay, so interactive happens at competition. Yeah. Queries are at competition. This would be guest. Qu is it going to be? We will see some of that. We can't even do instance search. Can we move? Just if I may ask, because that's kind of a huge trend in the community, that we probably shouldn't ignore, and we are almost there. Just kind of try to go just a little bit one step extra with the non-item search to kind of formulate it more as a conversational task. It is already there, so it would just take revealing partially more and more information. Can you give an example? For an example, like what I'm doing with Evangelos, for example, that's a colleague from information retrieval and this is like mostly text now but we are trying kind of to do the visual and with the Hongi and it's we set there Evangelos and I were thinking what are the good benchmarks for this kind of task multimodal conversational search and you know I told him VBS and lifebook search that's as close as it gets it doesn't exist there are data sets few data sets here and there so just to give an example so for example when you normally start revealing maybe we didn't think that way but I talked to Cajal several times about it you say for example aha I'm looking for a video Cajal says for example let's go first LSE and I'll give you VBS, you know, the same example, it's almost conversation. So Kahl says, aha our anonymous life logger was sitting in a chair, it was a home of a family member and I was looking at something on a wall and then people are looking for many things which are correct and not correct that's literally like what you do in the first round of interaction in first round of interaction conversational systems and then comes additional part of information that we sometimes keep as a ground truth like as a part of information that you are not aware of in conversational systems. And then you say, oh, it was a painting. And there was something white and red on it. So it's kind of giving you extras. So that is. Yeah, it's like our standard. And then comes, oh, those were the figures. It could be aliens, or it could be some type of information. So that's like people are developing conversational systems. Okay, we're there already. We're there already. Yeah, that's what I said. But some queries are not like that. I was just like saying when we select the queries actually to be queries that are also compatible with this. Well, all known item search queries are like that. The LSE item search queries are all like the vbc the vbs as well ad hoc find as many as we can yes they just have fewer stages yeah instant search find a single one not all of them they are kind of thinking no known item search all not not not avs but because that you don't want specify precisely, but all known item search queries are. Yeah, by known item search. Maybe we just kind of formulated slightly. Instant slash known item search. Then advertising. But then this means we would go for known item search and not for ad hoc, right? Yes. This is known item search. This is known item search. Conversational search is known item search. Yes, totally. We were discussing, but at some point you were not really persuaded that it's already conversational. It's not conversational, because conversational search, my understanding is, I say something to the system, the system has a question mark, I say something else, and there's this conversational talk. It's compatible with the conversational search. It's conversational search. Only conversational search. I mean, the other, the way, yeah, the way… It depends what kind of system people develop. No, no, we can't because the query is fixed. So if I ask you not what was on the picture, but if I ask you what color has the frame. Yeah, yeah, totally, totally. But these are really clarifying kind of further. That's often what they call conversational search in this fashion type of things. How this would work is Evangelist runs this as a workshop at ECIR in 2026. What do you think? Evangelist and you run this as a workshop at ECIR to build conversational search engines for life out there. But how is this a conversation? No, he should. He should. Oh yeah, totally. But how is this a conversation if there's only one party to the conversation and the output is just... You have an agent. So how I see it, but maybe it's wrong, we've been developing this kind of for very long, meaning when you started in 2006,2007 you would be doing Rokio and so on. We couldn't do better, you know what I mean? But that was already this primitive conversation with the system. The system gives you something, you label something as positive and negative, and then you go back and so on. So you're conversing in a system in a very primitive way. But the queries are fixed. They're just revealed over time. The conversation would be I give you some high level information and then you can ask whatever you want. Who's asking? You're out. We have more SD cards. I changed mine. Yes, we have more. Okay, you're a smart person. So does that mean we don't provide the data? Sometimes. I endeavor to. I think that's a different challenge. Yeah, I mean what you could do is, but this is a different... Turn it off first before you take out this deeper, please. What you could do is like, rather than prepare these list of hints, prepare like one page description of the scene you're looking for with a lot of detail. And then you could have this as an Oracle that people ask against. This is so complicated to do. It's complicated to do, yeah, because we would run that Oracle service somewhere and... I really kind of think because, you know why we shouldn't do it in case of... It's an easy IRIR challenge. It's ECIR. Yeah. And the other thing is, of course, who, I mean, if you do that based on an LLM, you couldn't ensure that the answers are exactly reproducible if different people use the Oracle. But this is essentially something that I... We use a data set to do these things. Go to CKR, go to VCR. Bring the clock to the lady. This is something I would have wanted to do as a different type of VBS task for a while. There is essentially that you would go ahead and have a volunteer show them the target beforehand and then they need to send their, okay, time to show, I describe and teams can, is it more or less, shout into, yeah, but what was this, what was that? Essentially have an ad hoc conversation for a VPS style setting, this could work. work. Yeah. For something like this. I mean, we could also do it here for the interactive part. We could also do it here. I'm a bit... In the first year, we should do it with low works. Yes. I'm a bit more hesitant for this because for if you if you do it for for vbs with something like v3c um the the possible universe of of things is so much larger that it's probably questions that are much more easy to answer quickly that's true yeah whereas somebody goes yeah but how exactly was this and then the person takes a while to answer this that's a conversational challenge rather than a retrieval challenge. We still focus on retrieval challenges. Can I just kind of try to explain? Because I don't know how much I should say because we didn't finish. We just started working with Hongi RPG. I can say about it. Hongi Wang. Hongi my PhD with the vanguards. What we started doing. Why I see it's actually conversation, can I? No, yes. But it's kind of in development stage, you know, like so I'm not sure that it works, so I don't like, so basically this is the general idea. When you formulate information need, and I think that's what you did well with VBS and LSE, when you kind of get an information need, are often not able kind of to formulate it clearly you know like or unwilling or so you want to use as short query as possible and get the relevant result you know. So we are now kind of developing some agents on both sides on retrieval and for information need and so on to handle those sites but actually what we have here is like really user that has information need but is either unwilling or unable to clearly formulate it as a very concise and detailed query so the system then retrieves something and these clarify information that came later on are there because nobody found relevant results so I think this is really good simulation of that information need and conversing"

But these are really clarifying kind of further. That's often what they call conversational search in this fashion type of things. How this would work is Evangelist runs this as a workshop at ECIR in 2026. What do you think? Evangelist and you run this as a workshop at ECIR to build conversational search engines for life out there. But how is this a conversation? No, he should. He should. Oh yeah, totally. But how is this a conversation if there's only one party to the conversation and the output is just... You have an agent. So how I see it, but maybe it's wrong, we've been developing this kind of for very long, meaning when you started in 2006,2007 you would be doing Rokio and so on. We couldn't do better, you know what I mean? But that was already this primitive conversation with the system. The system gives you something, you label something as positive and negative, and then you go back and so on. So you're conversing in a system in a very primitive way. But the queries are fixed. They're just revealed over time. The conversation would be I give you some high level information and then you can ask whatever you want. Who's asking? You're out. We have more SD cards. I changed mine. Yes, we have more. Okay, you're a smart person. So does that mean we don't provide the data? Sometimes. I endeavor to. I think that's a different challenge. Yeah, I mean what you could do is, but this is a different... Turn it off first before you take out this deeper, please. What you could do is like, rather than prepare these list of hints, prepare like one page description of the scene you're looking for with a lot of detail. And then you could have this as an Oracle that people ask against. This is so complicated to do. It's complicated to do, yeah, because we would run that Oracle service somewhere and... I really kind of think because, you know why we shouldn't do it in case of... It's an easy IRIR challenge. It's ECIR. Yeah. And the other thing is, of course, who, I mean, if you do that based on an LLM, you couldn't ensure that the answers are exactly reproducible if different people use the Oracle. But this is essentially something that I... We use a data set to do these things. Go to CKR, go to VCR. Bring the clock to the lady. This is something I would have wanted to do as a different type of VBS task for a while. There is essentially that you would go ahead and have a volunteer show them the target beforehand and then they need to send their, okay, time to show, I describe and teams can, is it more or less, shout into, yeah, but what was this, what was that? Essentially have an ad hoc conversation for a VPS style setting, this could work. work. Yeah. For something like this. I mean, we could also do it here for the interactive part. We could also do it here. I'm a bit... In the first year, we should do it with low works. Yes. I'm a bit more hesitant for this because for if you if you do it for for vbs with something like v3c um the the possible universe of of things is so much larger that it's probably questions that are much more easy to answer quickly that's true yeah whereas somebody goes yeah but how exactly was this and then the person takes a while to answer this that's a conversational challenge rather than a retrieval challenge. We still focus on retrieval challenges. Can I just kind of try to explain? Because I don't know how much I should say because we didn't finish. We just started working with Hongi RPG. I can say about it. Hongi Wang. Hongi my PhD with the vanguards. What we started doing. Why I see it's actually conversation, can I? No, yes. But it's kind of in development stage, you know, like so I'm not sure that it works, so I don't like, so basically this is the general idea. When you formulate information need, and I think that's what you did well with VBS and LSE, when you kind of get an information need, are often not able kind of to formulate it clearly you know like or unwilling or so you want to use as short query as possible and get the relevant result you know. So we are now kind of developing some agents on both sides on retrieval and for information need and so on to handle those sites but actually what we have here is like really user that has information need but is either unwilling or unable to clearly formulate it as a very concise and detailed query so the system then retrieves something and these clarify information that came later on are there because nobody found relevant results so I think this is really good simulation of that information need and conversing"

Just kind of try to go just a little bit one step extra with the non-item search to kind of formulate it more as a conversational task. It is already there, so it would just take revealing partially more and more information. Can you give an example? For an example, like what I'm doing with Evangelos, for example, that's a colleague from information retrieval and this is like mostly text now but we are trying kind of to do the visual and with the Hongi and it's we set there Evangelos and I were thinking what are the good benchmarks for this kind of task multimodal conversational search and you know I told him VBS and lifebook search that's as close as it gets it doesn't exist there are data sets few data sets here and there so just to give an example so for example when you normally start revealing maybe we didn't think that way but I talked to Cajal several times about it you say for example aha I'm looking for a video Cajal says for example let's go first LSE and I'll give you VBS, you know, the same example, it's almost conversation. So Kahl says, aha our anonymous life logger was sitting in a chair, it was a home of a family member and I was looking at something on a wall and then people are looking for many things which are correct and not correct that's literally like what you do in the first round of interaction in first round of interaction conversational systems and then comes additional part of information that we sometimes keep as a ground truth like as a part of information that you are not aware of in conversational systems. And then you say, oh, it was a painting. And there was something white and red on it. So it's kind of giving you extras. So that is. Yeah, it's like our standard. And then comes, oh, those were the figures. It could be aliens, or it could be some type of information. So that's like people are developing conversational systems. Okay, we're there already. We're there already. Yeah, that's what I said. But some queries are not like that. I was just like saying when we select the queries actually to be queries that are also compatible with this. Well, all known item search queries are like that. The LSE item search queries are all like the vbc the vbs as well ad hoc find as many as we can yes they just have fewer stages yeah instant search find a single one not all of them they are kind of thinking no known item search all not not not avs but because that you don't want specify precisely, but all known item search queries are. Yeah, by known item search. Maybe we just kind of formulated slightly. Instant slash known item search. Then advertising. But then this means we would go for known item search and not for ad hoc, right? Yes. This is known item search. This is known item search. Conversational search is known item search. Yes, totally. We were discussing, but at some point you were not really persuaded that it's already conversational. It's not conversational, because conversational search, my understanding is, I say something to the system, the system has a question mark, I say something else, and there's this conversational talk.

Yeah, by known item search. Maybe we just kind of formulated slightly. Instant slash known item search. Then advertising. But then this means we would go for known item search and not for ad hoc, right? Yes. This is known item search. This is known item search. Conversational search is known item search. Yes, totally. We were discussing, but at some point you were not really persuaded that it's already conversational. It's not conversational, because conversational search, my understanding is, I say something to the system, the system has a question mark, I say something else, and there's this conversational talk. It's compatible with the conversational search. It's conversational search. Only conversational search. I mean, the other, the way, yeah, the way… It depends what kind of system people develop. No, no, we can't because the query is fixed. So if I ask you not what was on the picture, but if I ask you what color has the frame. Yeah, yeah, totally, totally. But these are really clarifying kind of further. That's often what they call conversational search in this fashion type of things. How this would work is Evangelist runs this as a workshop at ECIR in 2026. What do you think? Evangelist and you run this as a workshop at ECIR to build conversational search engines for life out there. But how is this a conversation? No, he should. He should. Oh yeah, totally. But how is this a conversation if there's only one party to the conversation and the output is just... You have an agent. So how I see it, but maybe it's wrong, we've been developing this kind of for very long, meaning when you started in 2006,2007 you would be doing Rokio and so on. We couldn't do better, you know what I mean? But that was already this primitive conversation with the system. The system gives you something, you label something as positive and negative, and then you go back and so on. So you're conversing in a system in a very primitive way. But the queries are fixed. They're just revealed over time. The conversation would be I give you some high level information and then you can ask whatever you want. Who's asking? You're out. We have more SD cards. I changed mine. Yes, we have more. Okay, you're a smart person. So does that mean we don't provide the data? Sometimes. I endeavor to. I think that's a different challenge. Yeah, I mean what you could do is, but this is a different... Turn it off first before you take out this deeper, please. What you could do is like, rather than prepare these list of hints, prepare like one page description of the scene you're looking for with a lot of detail. And then you could have this as an Oracle that people ask against. This is so complicated to do. It's complicated to do, yeah, because we would run that Oracle service somewhere and... I really kind of think because, you know why we shouldn't do it in case of... It's an easy IRIR challenge. It's ECIR. Yeah. And the other thing is, of course, who, I mean, if you do that based on an LLM, you couldn't ensure that the answers are exactly reproducible if different people use the Oracle. But this is essentially something that I... We use a data set to do these things. Go to CKR, go to VCR. Bring the clock to the lady. This is something I would have wanted to do as a different type of VBS task for a while. There is essentially that you would go ahead and have a volunteer show them the target beforehand and then they need to send their, okay, time to show, I describe and teams can, is it more or less, shout into, yeah, but what was this, what was that? Essentially have an ad hoc conversation for a VPS style setting, this could work. work. Yeah. For something like this. I mean, we could also do it here for the interactive part. We could also do it here. I'm a bit... In the first year, we should do it with low works. Yes. I'm a bit more hesitant for this because for if you if you do it for for vbs with something like v3c um the the possible universe of of things is so much larger that it's probably questions that are much more easy to answer quickly that's true yeah whereas somebody goes yeah but how exactly was this and then the person takes a while to answer this that's a conversational challenge rather than a retrieval challenge. We still focus on retrieval challenges. Can I just kind of try to explain? Because I don't know how much I should say because we didn't finish. We just started working with Hongi RPG. I can say about it. Hongi Wang. Hongi my PhD with the vanguards. What we started doing. Why I see it's actually conversation, can I? No, yes. But it's kind of in development stage, you know, like so I'm not sure that it works, so I don't like, so basically this is the general idea. When you formulate information need, and I think that's what you did well with VBS and LSE, when you kind of get an information need, are often not able kind of to formulate it clearly you know like or unwilling or so you want to use as short query as possible and get the relevant result you know. So we are now kind of developing some agents on both sides on retrieval and for information need and so on to handle those sites but actually what we have here is like really user that has information need but is either unwilling or unable to clearly formulate it as a very concise and detailed query so the system then retrieves something and these clarify information that came later on are there because nobody found relevant results so I think this is really good simulation of that information need and conversing"

And then you say, oh, it was a painting. And there was something white and red on it. So it's kind of giving you extras. So that is. Yeah, it's like our standard. And then comes, oh, those were the figures. It could be aliens, or it could be some type of information. So that's like people are developing conversational systems. Okay, we're there already. We're there already. Yeah, that's what I said. But some queries are not like that. I was just like saying when we select the queries actually to be queries that are also compatible with this. Well, all known item search queries are like that. The LSE item search queries are all like the vbc the vbs as well ad hoc find as many as we can yes they just have fewer stages yeah instant search find a single one not all of them they are kind of thinking no known item search all not not not avs but because that you don't want specify precisely, but all known item search queries are. Yeah, by known item search. Maybe we just kind of formulated slightly. Instant slash known item search. Then advertising. But then this means we would go for known item search and not for ad hoc, right? Yes. This is known item search. This is known item search. Conversational search is known item search. Yes, totally. We were discussing, but at some point you were not really persuaded that it's already conversational. It's not conversational, because conversational search, my understanding is, I say something to the system, the system has a question mark, I say something else, and there's this conversational talk. It's compatible with the conversational search. It's conversational search. Only conversational search. I mean, the other, the way, yeah, the way… It depends what kind of system people develop. No, no, we can't because the query is fixed. So if I ask you not what was on the picture, but if I ask you what color has the frame. Yeah, yeah, totally, totally. But these are really clarifying kind of further. That's often what they call conversational search in this fashion type of things. How this would work is Evangelist runs this as a workshop at ECIR in 2026. What do you think? Evangelist and you run this as a workshop at ECIR to build conversational search engines for life out there. But how is this a conversation? No, he should. He should. Oh yeah, totally. But how is this a conversation if there's only one party to the conversation and the output is just... You have an agent. So how I see it, but maybe it's wrong, we've been developing this kind of for very long, meaning when you started in 2006,2007 you would be doing Rokio and so on. We couldn't do better, you know what I mean? But that was already this primitive conversation with the system. The system gives you something, you label something as positive and negative, and then you go back and so on. So you're conversing in a system in a very primitive way. But the queries are fixed. They're just revealed over time. The conversation would be I give you some high level information and then you can ask whatever you want. Who's asking? You're out. We have more SD cards. I changed mine. Yes, we have more. Okay, you're a smart person. So does that mean we don't provide the data? Sometimes. I endeavor to. I think that's a different challenge. Yeah, I mean what you could do is, but this is a different... Turn it off first before you take out this deeper, please. What you could do is like, rather than prepare these list of hints, prepare like one page description of the scene you're looking for with a lot of detail. And then you could have this as an Oracle that people ask against. This is so complicated to do. It's complicated to do, yeah, because we would run that Oracle service somewhere and... I really kind of think because, you know why we shouldn't do it in case of... It's an easy IRIR challenge. It's ECIR. Yeah. And the other thing is, of course, who, I mean, if you do that based on an LLM, you couldn't ensure that the answers are exactly reproducible if different people use the Oracle. But this is essentially something that I... We use a data set to do these things. Go to CKR, go to VCR. Bring the clock to the lady. This is something I would have wanted to do as a different type of VBS task for a while. There is essentially that you would go ahead and have a volunteer show them the target beforehand and then they need to send their, okay, time to show, I describe and teams can, is it more or less, shout into, yeah, but what was this, what was that? Essentially have an ad hoc conversation for a VPS style setting, this could work. work. Yeah. For something like this. I mean, we could also do it here for the interactive part. We could also do it here. I'm a bit... In the first year, we should do it with low works. Yes. I'm a bit more hesitant for this because for if you if you do it for for vbs with something like v3c um the the possible universe of of things is so much larger that it's probably questions that are much more easy to answer quickly that's true yeah whereas somebody goes yeah but how exactly was this and then the person takes a while to answer this that's a conversational challenge rather than a retrieval challenge. We still focus on retrieval challenges. Can I just kind of try to explain? Because I don't know how much I should say because we didn't finish. We just started working with Hongi RPG. I can say about it. Hongi Wang. Hongi my PhD with the vanguards. What we started doing. Why I see it's actually conversation, can I? No, yes. But it's kind of in development stage, you know, like so I'm not sure that it works, so I don't like, so basically this is the general idea. When you formulate information need, and I think that's what you did well with VBS and LSE, when you kind of get an information need, are often not able kind of to formulate it clearly you know like or unwilling or so you want to use as short query as possible and get the relevant result you know. So we are now kind of developing some agents on both sides on retrieval and for information need and so on to handle those sites but actually what we have here is like really user that has information need but is either unwilling or unable to clearly formulate it as a very concise and detailed query so the system then retrieves something and these clarify information that came later on are there because nobody found relevant results so I think this is really good simulation of that information need and conversing"

Qu is it going to be? We will see some of that. We can't even do instance search. Can we move? Just if I may ask, because that's kind of a huge trend in the community, that we probably shouldn't ignore, and we are almost there. Just kind of try to go just a little bit one step extra with the non-item search to kind of formulate it more as a conversational task. It is already there, so it would just take revealing partially more and more information. Can you give an example? For an example, like what I'm doing with Evangelos, for example, that's a colleague from information retrieval and this is like mostly text now but we are trying kind of to do the visual and with the Hongi and it's we set there Evangelos and I were thinking what are the good benchmarks for this kind of task multimodal conversational search and you know I told him VBS and lifebook search that's as close as it gets it doesn't exist there are data sets few data sets here and there so just to give an example so for example when you normally start revealing maybe we didn't think that way but I talked to Cajal several times about it you say for example aha I'm looking for a video Cajal says for example let's go first LSE and I'll give you VBS, you know, the same example, it's almost conversation. So Kahl says, aha our anonymous life logger was sitting in a chair, it was a home of a family member and I was looking at something on a wall and then people are looking for many things which are correct and not correct that's literally like what you do in the first round of interaction in first round of interaction conversational systems and then comes additional part of information that we sometimes keep as a ground truth like as a part of information that you are not aware of in conversational systems. And then you say, oh, it was a painting. And there was something white and red on it. So it's kind of giving you extras. So that is. Yeah, it's like our standard. And then comes, oh, those were the figures. It could be aliens, or it could be some type of information. So that's like people are developing conversational systems. Okay, we're there already. We're there already. Yeah, that's what I said. But some queries are not like that. I was just like saying when we select the queries actually to be queries that are also compatible with this. Well, all known item search queries are like that. The LSE item search queries are all like the vbc the vbs as well ad hoc find as many as we can yes they just have fewer stages yeah instant search find a single one not all of them they are kind of thinking no known item search all not not not avs but because that you don't want specify precisely, but all known item search queries are. Yeah, by known item search. Maybe we just kind of formulated slightly. Instant slash known item search. Then advertising. But then this means we would go for known item search and not for ad hoc, right? Yes. This is known item search. This is known item search. Conversational search is known item search. Yes, totally. We were discussing, but at some point you were not really persuaded that it's already conversational. It's not conversational, because conversational search, my understanding is, I say something to the system, the system has a question mark, I say something else, and there's this conversational talk. It's compatible with the conversational search. It's conversational search. Only conversational search. I mean, the other, the way, yeah, the way… It depends what kind of system people develop. No, no, we can't because the query is fixed. So if I ask you not what was on the picture, but if I ask you what color has the frame. Yeah, yeah, totally, totally. But these are really clarifying kind of further. That's often what they call conversational search in this fashion type of things. How this would work is Evangelist runs this as a workshop at ECIR in 2026. What do you think? Evangelist and you run this as a workshop at ECIR to build conversational search engines for life out there. But how is this a conversation? No, he should. He should. Oh yeah, totally. But how is this a conversation if there's only one party to the conversation and the output is just... You have an agent. So how I see it, but maybe it's wrong, we've been developing this kind of for very long, meaning when you started in 2006,2007 you would be doing Rokio and so on. We couldn't do better, you know what I mean? But that was already this primitive conversation with the system. The system gives you something, you label something as positive and negative, and then you go back and so on. So you're conversing in a system in a very primitive way. But the queries are fixed. They're just revealed over time. The conversation would be I give you some high level information and then you can ask whatever you want. Who's asking? You're out. We have more SD cards. I changed mine. Yes, we have more. Okay, you're a smart person. So does that mean we don't provide the data? Sometimes. I endeavor to. I think that's a different challenge. Yeah, I mean what you could do is, but this is a different... Turn it off first before you take out this deeper, please. What you could do is like, rather than prepare these list of hints, prepare like one page description of the scene you're looking for with a lot of detail. And then you could have this as an Oracle that people ask against. This is so complicated to do. It's complicated to do, yeah, because we would run that Oracle service somewhere and... I really kind of think because, you know why we shouldn't do it in case of... It's an easy IRIR challenge. It's ECIR. Yeah. And the other thing is, of course, who, I mean, if you do that based on an LLM, you couldn't ensure that the answers are exactly reproducible if different people use the Oracle. But this is essentially something that I... We use a data set to do these things. Go to CKR, go to VCR. Bring the clock to the lady. This is something I would have wanted to do as a different type of VBS task for a while. There is essentially that you would go ahead and have a volunteer show them the target beforehand and then they need to send their, okay, time to show, I describe and teams can, is it more or less, shout into, yeah, but what was this, what was that? Essentially have an ad hoc conversation for a VPS style setting, this could work. work. Yeah. For something like this. I mean, we could also do it here for the interactive part. We could also do it here. I'm a bit... In the first year, we should do it with low works. Yes. I'm a bit more hesitant for this because for if you if you do it for for vbs with something like v3c um the the possible universe of of things is so much larger that it's probably questions that are much more easy to answer quickly that's true yeah whereas somebody goes yeah but how exactly was this and then the person takes a while to answer this that's a conversational challenge rather than a retrieval challenge. We still focus on retrieval challenges. Can I just kind of try to explain? Because I don't know how much I should say because we didn't finish. We just started working with Hongi RPG. I can say about it. Hongi Wang. Hongi my PhD with the vanguards. What we started doing. Why I see it's actually conversation, can I? No, yes. But it's kind of in development stage, you know, like so I'm not sure that it works, so I don't like, so basically this is the general idea. When you formulate information need, and I think that's what you did well with VBS and LSE, when you kind of get an information need, are often not able kind of to formulate it clearly you know like or unwilling or so you want to use as short query as possible and get the relevant result you know. So we are now kind of developing some agents on both sides on retrieval and for information need and so on to handle those sites but actually what we have here is like really user that has information need but is either unwilling or unable to clearly formulate it as a very concise and detailed query so the system then retrieves something and these clarify information that came later on are there because nobody found relevant results so I think this is really good simulation of that information need and conversing"

So we are now kind of developing some agents on both sides on retrieval and for information need and so on to handle those sites but actually what we have here is like really user that has information need but is either unwilling or unable to clearly formulate it as a very concise and detailed query so the system then retrieves something and these clarify information that came later on are there because nobody found relevant results so I think this is really good simulation of that information need and conversing"

You just need to specify it. Yeah, exactly. So why not? Okay, so interactive happens at competition. Yeah. Queries are at competition. This would be guest. Qu is it going to be? We will see some of that. We can't even do instance search. Can we move? Just if I may ask, because that's kind of a huge trend in the community, that we probably shouldn't ignore, and we are almost there. Just kind of try to go just a little bit one step extra with the non-item search to kind of formulate it more as a conversational task. It is already there, so it would just take revealing partially more and more information. Can you give an example? For an example, like what I'm doing with Evangelos, for example, that's a colleague from information retrieval and this is like mostly text now but we are trying kind of to do the visual and with the Hongi and it's we set there Evangelos and I were thinking what are the good benchmarks for this kind of task multimodal conversational search and you know I told him VBS and lifebook search that's as close as it gets it doesn't exist there are data sets few data sets here and there so just to give an example so for example when you normally start revealing maybe we didn't think that way but I talked to Cajal several times about it you say for example aha I'm looking for a video Cajal says for example let's go first LSE and I'll give you VBS, you know, the same example, it's almost conversation. So Kahl says, aha our anonymous life logger was sitting in a chair, it was a home of a family member and I was looking at something on a wall and then people are looking for many things which are correct and not correct that's literally like what you do in the first round of interaction in first round of interaction conversational systems and then comes additional part of information that we sometimes keep as a ground truth like as a part of information that you are not aware of in conversational systems. And then you say, oh, it was a painting. And there was something white and red on it. So it's kind of giving you extras. So that is. Yeah, it's like our standard. And then comes, oh, those were the figures. It could be aliens, or it could be some type of information. So that's like people are developing conversational systems. Okay, we're there already. We're there already. Yeah, that's what I said. But some queries are not like that. I was just like saying when we select the queries actually to be queries that are also compatible with this. Well, all known item search queries are like that. The LSE item search queries are all like the vbc the vbs as well ad hoc find as many as we can yes they just have fewer stages yeah instant search find a single one not all of them they are kind of thinking no known item search all not not not avs but because that you don't want specify precisely, but all known item search queries are. Yeah, by known item search. Maybe we just kind of formulated slightly. Instant slash known item search. Then advertising. But then this means we would go for known item search and not for ad hoc, right? Yes. This is known item search. This is known item search. Conversational search is known item search. Yes, totally. We were discussing, but at some point you were not really persuaded that it's already conversational. It's not conversational, because conversational search, my understanding is, I say something to the system, the system has a question mark, I say something else, and there's this conversational talk. It's compatible with the conversational search. It's conversational search. Only conversational search. I mean, the other, the way, yeah, the way… It depends what kind of system people develop. No, no, we can't because the query is fixed. So if I ask you not what was on the picture, but if I ask you what color has the frame. Yeah, yeah, totally, totally. But these are really clarifying kind of further. That's often what they call conversational search in this fashion type of things. How this would work is Evangelist runs this as a workshop at ECIR in 2026. What do you think? Evangelist and you run this as a workshop at ECIR to build conversational search engines for life out there. But how is this a conversation? No, he should. He should. Oh yeah, totally. But how is this a conversation if there's only one party to the conversation and the output is just... You have an agent. So how I see it, but maybe it's wrong, we've been developing this kind of for very long, meaning when you started in 2006,2007 you would be doing Rokio and so on. We couldn't do better, you know what I mean? But that was already this primitive conversation with the system. The system gives you something, you label something as positive and negative, and then you go back and so on. So you're conversing in a system in a very primitive way. But the queries are fixed. They're just revealed over time. The conversation would be I give you some high level information and then you can ask whatever you want. Who's asking? You're out. We have more SD cards. I changed mine. Yes, we have more. Okay, you're a smart person. So does that mean we don't provide the data? Sometimes. I endeavor to. I think that's a different challenge. Yeah, I mean what you could do is, but this is a different... Turn it off first before you take out this deeper, please. What you could do is like, rather than prepare these list of hints, prepare like one page description of the scene you're looking for with a lot of detail. And then you could have this as an Oracle that people ask against. This is so complicated to do. It's complicated to do, yeah, because we would run that Oracle service somewhere and... I really kind of think because, you know why we shouldn't do it in case of... It's an easy IRIR challenge. It's ECIR. Yeah. And the other thing is, of course, who, I mean, if you do that based on an LLM, you couldn't ensure that the answers are exactly reproducible if different people use the Oracle. But this is essentially something that I... We use a data set to do these things. Go to CKR, go to VCR. Bring the clock to the lady. This is something I would have wanted to do as a different type of VBS task for a while. There is essentially that you would go ahead and have a volunteer show them the target beforehand and then they need to send their, okay, time to show, I describe and teams can, is it more or less, shout into, yeah, but what was this, what was that? Essentially have an ad hoc conversation for a VPS style setting, this could work. work. Yeah. For something like this. I mean, we could also do it here for the interactive part. We could also do it here. I'm a bit... In the first year, we should do it with low works. Yes. I'm a bit more hesitant for this because for if you if you do it for for vbs with something like v3c um the the possible universe of of things is so much larger that it's probably questions that are much more easy to answer quickly that's true yeah whereas somebody goes yeah but how exactly was this and then the person takes a while to answer this that's a conversational challenge rather than a retrieval challenge. We still focus on retrieval challenges. Can I just kind of try to explain? Because I don't know how much I should say because we didn't finish. We just started working with Hongi RPG. I can say about it. Hongi Wang. Hongi my PhD with the vanguards. What we started doing. Why I see it's actually conversation, can I? No, yes.

I'm a bit more hesitant for this because for if you if you do it for for vbs with something like v3c um the the possible universe of of things is so much larger that it's probably questions that are much more easy to answer quickly that's true yeah whereas somebody goes yeah but how exactly was this and then the person takes a while to answer this that's a conversational challenge rather than a retrieval challenge. We still focus on retrieval challenges. Can I just kind of try to explain? Because I don't know how much I should say because we didn't finish. We just started working with Hongi RPG. I can say about it. Hongi Wang. Hongi my PhD with the vanguards. What we started doing. Why I see it's actually conversation, can I? No, yes. But it's kind of in development stage, you know, like so I'm not sure that it works, so I don't like, so basically this is the general idea. When you formulate information need, and I think that's what you did well with VBS and LSE, when you kind of get an information need, are often not able kind of to formulate it clearly you know like or unwilling or so you want to use as short query as possible and get the relevant result you know. So we are now kind of developing some agents on both sides on retrieval and for information need and so on to handle those sites but actually what we have here is like really user that has information need but is either unwilling or unable to clearly formulate it as a very concise and detailed query so the system then retrieves something and these clarify information that came later on are there because nobody found relevant results so I think this is really good simulation of that information need and conversing"
Discussing,2618,2619," Arš! Arš! Thank you. you you you you you you you you you you you... Automatisch? Ja. Automatic? Automatic. Yeah, it's directly with the loudspeaker. You just need to specify it. Yeah, exactly. So why not? Okay, so interactive happens at competition. Yeah. Queries are at competition. This would be guest. Qu is it going to be? We will see some of that. We can't even do instance search. Can we move? Just if I may ask, because that's kind of a huge trend in the community, that we probably shouldn't ignore, and we are almost there. Just kind of try to go just a little bit one step extra with the non-item search to kind of formulate it more as a conversational task. It is already there, so it would just take revealing partially more and more information. Can you give an example? For an example, like what I'm doing with Evangelos, for example, that's a colleague from information retrieval and this is like mostly text now but we are trying kind of to do the visual and with the Hongi and it's we set there Evangelos and I were thinking what are the good benchmarks for this kind of task multimodal conversational search and you know I told him VBS and lifebook search that's as close as it gets it doesn't exist there are data sets few data sets here and there so just to give an example so for example when you normally start revealing maybe we didn't think that way but I talked to Cajal several times about it you say for example aha I'm looking for a video Cajal says for example let's go first LSE and I'll give you VBS, you know, the same example, it's almost conversation. So Kahl says, aha our anonymous life logger was sitting in a chair, it was a home of a family member and I was looking at something on a wall and then people are looking for many things which are correct and not correct that's literally like what you do in the first round of interaction in first round of interaction conversational systems and then comes additional part of information that we sometimes keep as a ground truth like as a part of information that you are not aware of in conversational systems. And then you say, oh, it was a painting. And there was something white and red on it. So it's kind of giving you extras. So that is. Yeah, it's like our standard. And then comes, oh, those were the figures. It could be aliens, or it could be some type of information. So that's like people are developing conversational systems. Okay, we're there already. We're there already. Yeah, that's what I said. But some queries are not like that. I was just like saying when we select the queries actually to be queries that are also compatible with this. Well, all known item search queries are like that. The LSE item search queries are all like the vbc the vbs as well ad hoc find as many as we can yes they just have fewer stages yeah instant search find a single one not all of them they are kind of thinking no known item search all not not not avs but because that you don't want specify precisely, but all known item search queries are. Yeah, by known item search. Maybe we just kind of formulated slightly. Instant slash known item search. Then advertising. But then this means we would go for known item search and not for ad hoc, right? Yes. This is known item search. This is known item search. Conversational search is known item search. Yes, totally. We were discussing, but at some point you were not really persuaded that it's already conversational. It's not conversational, because conversational search, my understanding is, I say something to the system, the system has a question mark, I say something else, and there's this conversational talk. It's compatible with the conversational search. It's conversational search. Only conversational search. I mean, the other, the way, yeah, the way… It depends what kind of system people develop. No, no, we can't because the query is fixed. So if I ask you not what was on the picture, but if I ask you what color has the frame. Yeah, yeah, totally, totally. But these are really clarifying kind of further. That's often what they call conversational search in this fashion type of things. How this would work is Evangelist runs this as a workshop at ECIR in 2026. What do you think? Evangelist and you run this as a workshop at ECIR to build conversational search engines for life out there. But how is this a conversation? No, he should. He should. Oh yeah, totally. But how is this a conversation if there's only one party to the conversation and the output is just... You have an agent. So how I see it, but maybe it's wrong, we've been developing this kind of for very long, meaning when you started in 2006,2007 you would be doing Rokio and so on. We couldn't do better, you know what I mean? But that was already this primitive conversation with the system. The system gives you something, you label something as positive and negative, and then you go back and so on. So you're conversing in a system in a very primitive way. But the queries are fixed. They're just revealed over time. The conversation would be I give you some high level information and then you can ask whatever you want. Who's asking? You're out. We have more SD cards. I changed mine. Yes, we have more. Okay, you're a smart person. So does that mean we don't provide the data? Sometimes. I endeavor to. I think that's a different challenge. Yeah, I mean what you could do is, but this is a different... Turn it off first before you take out this deeper, please. What you could do is like, rather than prepare these list of hints, prepare like one page description of the scene you're looking for with a lot of detail. And then you could have this as an Oracle that people ask against. This is so complicated to do. It's complicated to do, yeah, because we would run that Oracle service somewhere and... I really kind of think because, you know why we shouldn't do it in case of... It's an easy IRIR challenge. It's ECIR. Yeah. And the other thing is, of course, who, I mean, if you do that based on an LLM, you couldn't ensure that the answers are exactly reproducible if different people use the Oracle. But this is essentially something that I... We use a data set to do these things. Go to CKR, go to VCR. Bring the clock to the lady. This is something I would have wanted to do as a different type of VBS task for a while. There is essentially that you would go ahead and have a volunteer show them the target beforehand and then they need to send their, okay, time to show, I describe and teams can, is it more or less, shout into, yeah, but what was this, what was that? Essentially have an ad hoc conversation for a VPS style setting, this could work. work. Yeah. For something like this. I mean, we could also do it here for the interactive part.

And the other thing is, of course, who, I mean, if you do that based on an LLM, you couldn't ensure that the answers are exactly reproducible if different people use the Oracle. But this is essentially something that I... We use a data set to do these things. Go to CKR, go to VCR. Bring the clock to the lady. This is something I would have wanted to do as a different type of VBS task for a while. There is essentially that you would go ahead and have a volunteer show them the target beforehand and then they need to send their, okay, time to show, I describe and teams can, is it more or less, shout into, yeah, but what was this, what was that? Essentially have an ad hoc conversation for a VPS style setting, this could work. work. Yeah. For something like this. I mean, we could also do it here for the interactive part. We could also do it here. I'm a bit... In the first year, we should do it with low works. Yes. I'm a bit more hesitant for this because for if you if you do it for for vbs with something like v3c um the the possible universe of of things is so much larger that it's probably questions that are much more easy to answer quickly that's true yeah whereas somebody goes yeah but how exactly was this and then the person takes a while to answer this that's a conversational challenge rather than a retrieval challenge. We still focus on retrieval challenges. Can I just kind of try to explain? Because I don't know how much I should say because we didn't finish. We just started working with Hongi RPG. I can say about it. Hongi Wang. Hongi my PhD with the vanguards. What we started doing. Why I see it's actually conversation, can I? No, yes. But it's kind of in development stage, you know, like so I'm not sure that it works, so I don't like, so basically this is the general idea. When you formulate information need, and I think that's what you did well with VBS and LSE, when you kind of get an information need, are often not able kind of to formulate it clearly you know like or unwilling or so you want to use as short query as possible and get the relevant result you know. So we are now kind of developing some agents on both sides on retrieval and for information need and so on to handle those sites but actually what we have here is like really user that has information need but is either unwilling or unable to clearly formulate it as a very concise and detailed query so the system then retrieves something and these clarify information that came later on are there because nobody found relevant results so I think this is really good simulation of that information need and conversing"
Sitting,2890,2891," Arš! Arš! Thank you. you you you you you you you you you you you... Automatisch? Ja. Automatic? Automatic. Yeah, it's directly with the loudspeaker. You just need to specify it. Yeah, exactly. So why not? Okay, so interactive happens at competition. Yeah. Queries are at competition. This would be guest. Qu is it going to be? We will see some of that. We can't even do instance search. Can we move? Just if I may ask, because that's kind of a huge trend in the community, that we probably shouldn't ignore, and we are almost there. Just kind of try to go just a little bit one step extra with the non-item search to kind of formulate it more as a conversational task. It is already there, so it would just take revealing partially more and more information. Can you give an example? For an example, like what I'm doing with Evangelos, for example, that's a colleague from information retrieval and this is like mostly text now but we are trying kind of to do the visual and with the Hongi and it's we set there Evangelos and I were thinking what are the good benchmarks for this kind of task multimodal conversational search and you know I told him VBS and lifebook search that's as close as it gets it doesn't exist there are data sets few data sets here and there so just to give an example so for example when you normally start revealing maybe we didn't think that way but I talked to Cajal several times about it you say for example aha I'm looking for a video Cajal says for example let's go first LSE and I'll give you VBS, you know, the same example, it's almost conversation. So Kahl says, aha our anonymous life logger was sitting in a chair, it was a home of a family member and I was looking at something on a wall and then people are looking for many things which are correct and not correct that's literally like what you do in the first round of interaction in first round of interaction conversational systems and then comes additional part of information that we sometimes keep as a ground truth like as a part of information that you are not aware of in conversational systems. And then you say, oh, it was a painting. And there was something white and red on it. So it's kind of giving you extras. So that is. Yeah, it's like our standard. And then comes, oh, those were the figures. It could be aliens, or it could be some type of information. So that's like people are developing conversational systems. Okay, we're there already. We're there already. Yeah, that's what I said. But some queries are not like that. I was just like saying when we select the queries actually to be queries that are also compatible with this. Well, all known item search queries are like that. The LSE item search queries are all like the vbc the vbs as well ad hoc find as many as we can yes they just have fewer stages yeah instant search find a single one not all of them they are kind of thinking no known item search all not not not avs but because that you don't want specify precisely, but all known item search queries are. Yeah, by known item search. Maybe we just kind of formulated slightly. Instant slash known item search. Then advertising. But then this means we would go for known item search and not for ad hoc, right? Yes. This is known item search. This is known item search. Conversational search is known item search. Yes, totally. We were discussing, but at some point you were not really persuaded that it's already conversational. It's not conversational, because conversational search, my understanding is, I say something to the system, the system has a question mark, I say something else, and there's this conversational talk. It's compatible with the conversational search. It's conversational search. Only conversational search. I mean, the other, the way, yeah, the way… It depends what kind of system people develop. No, no, we can't because the query is fixed. So if I ask you not what was on the picture, but if I ask you what color has the frame. Yeah, yeah, totally, totally. But these are really clarifying kind of further. That's often what they call conversational search in this fashion type of things. How this would work is Evangelist runs this as a workshop at ECIR in 2026. What do you think? Evangelist and you run this as a workshop at ECIR to build conversational search engines for life out there. But how is this a conversation? No, he should. He should. Oh yeah, totally. But how is this a conversation if there's only one party to the conversation and the output is just... You have an agent. So how I see it, but maybe it's wrong, we've been developing this kind of for very long, meaning when you started in 2006,2007 you would be doing Rokio and so on. We couldn't do better, you know what I mean? But that was already this primitive conversation with the system. The system gives you something, you label something as positive and negative, and then you go back and so on. So you're conversing in a system in a very primitive way. But the queries are fixed. They're just revealed over time. The conversation would be I give you some high level information and then you can ask whatever you want. Who's asking? You're out. We have more SD cards. I changed mine. Yes, we have more. Okay, you're a smart person. So does that mean we don't provide the data? Sometimes. I endeavor to. I think that's a different challenge. Yeah, I mean what you could do is, but this is a different... Turn it off first before you take out this deeper, please. What you could do is like, rather than prepare these list of hints, prepare like one page description of the scene you're looking for with a lot of detail. And then you could have this as an Oracle that people ask against. This is so complicated to do. It's complicated to do, yeah, because we would run that Oracle service somewhere and...

I changed mine. Yes, we have more. Okay, you're a smart person. So does that mean we don't provide the data? Sometimes. I endeavor to. I think that's a different challenge. Yeah, I mean what you could do is, but this is a different... Turn it off first before you take out this deeper, please. What you could do is like, rather than prepare these list of hints, prepare like one page description of the scene you're looking for with a lot of detail. And then you could have this as an Oracle that people ask against. This is so complicated to do. It's complicated to do, yeah, because we would run that Oracle service somewhere and... I really kind of think because, you know why we shouldn't do it in case of... It's an easy IRIR challenge. It's ECIR. Yeah. And the other thing is, of course, who, I mean, if you do that based on an LLM, you couldn't ensure that the answers are exactly reproducible if different people use the Oracle. But this is essentially something that I... We use a data set to do these things. Go to CKR, go to VCR. Bring the clock to the lady. This is something I would have wanted to do as a different type of VBS task for a while. There is essentially that you would go ahead and have a volunteer show them the target beforehand and then they need to send their, okay, time to show, I describe and teams can, is it more or less, shout into, yeah, but what was this, what was that? Essentially have an ad hoc conversation for a VPS style setting, this could work. work. Yeah. For something like this. I mean, we could also do it here for the interactive part. We could also do it here. I'm a bit... In the first year, we should do it with low works. Yes. I'm a bit more hesitant for this because for if you if you do it for for vbs with something like v3c um the the possible universe of of things is so much larger that it's probably questions that are much more easy to answer quickly that's true yeah whereas somebody goes yeah but how exactly was this and then the person takes a while to answer this that's a conversational challenge rather than a retrieval challenge. We still focus on retrieval challenges. Can I just kind of try to explain? Because I don't know how much I should say because we didn't finish. We just started working with Hongi RPG. I can say about it. Hongi Wang. Hongi my PhD with the vanguards. What we started doing. Why I see it's actually conversation, can I? No, yes. But it's kind of in development stage, you know, like so I'm not sure that it works, so I don't like, so basically this is the general idea. When you formulate information need, and I think that's what you did well with VBS and LSE, when you kind of get an information need, are often not able kind of to formulate it clearly you know like or unwilling or so you want to use as short query as possible and get the relevant result you know. So we are now kind of developing some agents on both sides on retrieval and for information need and so on to handle those sites but actually what we have here is like really user that has information need but is either unwilling or unable to clearly formulate it as a very concise and detailed query so the system then retrieves something and these clarify information that came later on are there because nobody found relevant results so I think this is really good simulation of that information need and conversing"
Using Laptop,2895,2896," Arš! Arš! Thank you. you you you you you you you you you you you... Automatisch? Ja. Automatic? Automatic. Yeah, it's directly with the loudspeaker. You just need to specify it. Yeah, exactly. So why not? Okay, so interactive happens at competition. Yeah. Queries are at competition. This would be guest. Qu is it going to be? We will see some of that. We can't even do instance search. Can we move? Just if I may ask, because that's kind of a huge trend in the community, that we probably shouldn't ignore, and we are almost there. Just kind of try to go just a little bit one step extra with the non-item search to kind of formulate it more as a conversational task. It is already there, so it would just take revealing partially more and more information. Can you give an example? For an example, like what I'm doing with Evangelos, for example, that's a colleague from information retrieval and this is like mostly text now but we are trying kind of to do the visual and with the Hongi and it's we set there Evangelos and I were thinking what are the good benchmarks for this kind of task multimodal conversational search and you know I told him VBS and lifebook search that's as close as it gets it doesn't exist there are data sets few data sets here and there so just to give an example so for example when you normally start revealing maybe we didn't think that way but I talked to Cajal several times about it you say for example aha I'm looking for a video Cajal says for example let's go first LSE and I'll give you VBS, you know, the same example, it's almost conversation. So Kahl says, aha our anonymous life logger was sitting in a chair, it was a home of a family member and I was looking at something on a wall and then people are looking for many things which are correct and not correct that's literally like what you do in the first round of interaction in first round of interaction conversational systems and then comes additional part of information that we sometimes keep as a ground truth like as a part of information that you are not aware of in conversational systems. And then you say, oh, it was a painting. And there was something white and red on it. So it's kind of giving you extras. So that is. Yeah, it's like our standard. And then comes, oh, those were the figures. It could be aliens, or it could be some type of information. So that's like people are developing conversational systems. Okay, we're there already. We're there already. Yeah, that's what I said. But some queries are not like that. I was just like saying when we select the queries actually to be queries that are also compatible with this. Well, all known item search queries are like that. The LSE item search queries are all like the vbc the vbs as well ad hoc find as many as we can yes they just have fewer stages yeah instant search find a single one not all of them they are kind of thinking no known item search all not not not avs but because that you don't want specify precisely, but all known item search queries are. Yeah, by known item search. Maybe we just kind of formulated slightly. Instant slash known item search. Then advertising. But then this means we would go for known item search and not for ad hoc, right? Yes. This is known item search. This is known item search. Conversational search is known item search. Yes, totally. We were discussing, but at some point you were not really persuaded that it's already conversational. It's not conversational, because conversational search, my understanding is, I say something to the system, the system has a question mark, I say something else, and there's this conversational talk. It's compatible with the conversational search. It's conversational search. Only conversational search. I mean, the other, the way, yeah, the way… It depends what kind of system people develop. No, no, we can't because the query is fixed. So if I ask you not what was on the picture, but if I ask you what color has the frame. Yeah, yeah, totally, totally. But these are really clarifying kind of further. That's often what they call conversational search in this fashion type of things. How this would work is Evangelist runs this as a workshop at ECIR in 2026. What do you think? Evangelist and you run this as a workshop at ECIR to build conversational search engines for life out there. But how is this a conversation? No, he should. He should. Oh yeah, totally. But how is this a conversation if there's only one party to the conversation and the output is just... You have an agent. So how I see it, but maybe it's wrong, we've been developing this kind of for very long, meaning when you started in 2006,2007 you would be doing Rokio and so on. We couldn't do better, you know what I mean? But that was already this primitive conversation with the system.

So how I see it, but maybe it's wrong, we've been developing this kind of for very long, meaning when you started in 2006,2007 you would be doing Rokio and so on. We couldn't do better, you know what I mean? But that was already this primitive conversation with the system. The system gives you something, you label something as positive and negative, and then you go back and so on. So you're conversing in a system in a very primitive way. But the queries are fixed. They're just revealed over time. The conversation would be I give you some high level information and then you can ask whatever you want. Who's asking? You're out. We have more SD cards. I changed mine. Yes, we have more. Okay, you're a smart person. So does that mean we don't provide the data? Sometimes. I endeavor to. I think that's a different challenge. Yeah, I mean what you could do is, but this is a different... Turn it off first before you take out this deeper, please. What you could do is like, rather than prepare these list of hints, prepare like one page description of the scene you're looking for with a lot of detail. And then you could have this as an Oracle that people ask against. This is so complicated to do. It's complicated to do, yeah, because we would run that Oracle service somewhere and... I really kind of think because, you know why we shouldn't do it in case of... It's an easy IRIR challenge. It's ECIR. Yeah. And the other thing is, of course, who, I mean, if you do that based on an LLM, you couldn't ensure that the answers are exactly reproducible if different people use the Oracle. But this is essentially something that I... We use a data set to do these things. Go to CKR, go to VCR. Bring the clock to the lady. This is something I would have wanted to do as a different type of VBS task for a while. There is essentially that you would go ahead and have a volunteer show them the target beforehand and then they need to send their, okay, time to show, I describe and teams can, is it more or less, shout into, yeah, but what was this, what was that? Essentially have an ad hoc conversation for a VPS style setting, this could work. work. Yeah. For something like this. I mean, we could also do it here for the interactive part. We could also do it here. I'm a bit... In the first year, we should do it with low works. Yes. I'm a bit more hesitant for this because for if you if you do it for for vbs with something like v3c um the the possible universe of of things is so much larger that it's probably questions that are much more easy to answer quickly that's true yeah whereas somebody goes yeah but how exactly was this and then the person takes a while to answer this that's a conversational challenge rather than a retrieval challenge. We still focus on retrieval challenges. Can I just kind of try to explain? Because I don't know how much I should say because we didn't finish. We just started working with Hongi RPG. I can say about it. Hongi Wang. Hongi my PhD with the vanguards. What we started doing. Why I see it's actually conversation, can I? No, yes. But it's kind of in development stage, you know, like so I'm not sure that it works, so I don't like, so basically this is the general idea. When you formulate information need, and I think that's what you did well with VBS and LSE, when you kind of get an information need, are often not able kind of to formulate it clearly you know like or unwilling or so you want to use as short query as possible and get the relevant result you know. So we are now kind of developing some agents on both sides on retrieval and for information need and so on to handle those sites but actually what we have here is like really user that has information need but is either unwilling or unable to clearly formulate it as a very concise and detailed query so the system then retrieves something and these clarify information that came later on are there because nobody found relevant results so I think this is really good simulation of that information need and conversing"
Leisure Activities,2905,2906," Arš! Arš! Thank you. you you you you you you you you you you you... Automatisch? Ja. Automatic? Automatic. Yeah, it's directly with the loudspeaker. You just need to specify it. Yeah, exactly. So why not? Okay, so interactive happens at competition. Yeah. Queries are at competition. This would be guest. Qu is it going to be? We will see some of that. We can't even do instance search. Can we move? Just if I may ask, because that's kind of a huge trend in the community, that we probably shouldn't ignore, and we are almost there. Just kind of try to go just a little bit one step extra with the non-item search to kind of formulate it more as a conversational task. It is already there, so it would just take revealing partially more and more information. Can you give an example? For an example, like what I'm doing with Evangelos, for example, that's a colleague from information retrieval and this is like mostly text now but we are trying kind of to do the visual and with the Hongi and it's we set there Evangelos and I were thinking what are the good benchmarks for this kind of task multimodal conversational search and you know I told him VBS and lifebook search that's as close as it gets it doesn't exist there are data sets few data sets here and there so just to give an example so for example when you normally start revealing maybe we didn't think that way but I talked to Cajal several times about it you say for example aha I'm looking for a video Cajal says for example let's go first LSE and I'll give you VBS, you know, the same example, it's almost conversation. So Kahl says, aha our anonymous life logger was sitting in a chair, it was a home of a family member and I was looking at something on a wall and then people are looking for many things which are correct and not correct that's literally like what you do in the first round of interaction in first round of interaction conversational systems and then comes additional part of information that we sometimes keep as a ground truth like as a part of information that you are not aware of in conversational systems. And then you say, oh, it was a painting. And there was something white and red on it. So it's kind of giving you extras. So that is. Yeah, it's like our standard. And then comes, oh, those were the figures. It could be aliens, or it could be some type of information. So that's like people are developing conversational systems. Okay, we're there already. We're there already. Yeah, that's what I said. But some queries are not like that. I was just like saying when we select the queries actually to be queries that are also compatible with this. Well, all known item search queries are like that. The LSE item search queries are all like the vbc the vbs as well ad hoc find as many as we can yes they just have fewer stages yeah instant search find a single one not all of them they are kind of thinking no known item search all not not not avs but because that you don't want specify precisely, but all known item search queries are. Yeah, by known item search. Maybe we just kind of formulated slightly. Instant slash known item search. Then advertising. But then this means we would go for known item search and not for ad hoc, right? Yes. This is known item search. This is known item search. Conversational search is known item search. Yes, totally. We were discussing, but at some point you were not really persuaded that it's already conversational. It's not conversational, because conversational search, my understanding is, I say something to the system, the system has a question mark, I say something else, and there's this conversational talk. It's compatible with the conversational search. It's conversational search. Only conversational search. I mean, the other, the way, yeah, the way… It depends what kind of system people develop. No, no, we can't because the query is fixed. So if I ask you not what was on the picture, but if I ask you what color has the frame. Yeah, yeah, totally, totally. But these are really clarifying kind of further. That's often what they call conversational search in this fashion type of things. How this would work is Evangelist runs this as a workshop at ECIR in 2026. What do you think?

No, no, we can't because the query is fixed. So if I ask you not what was on the picture, but if I ask you what color has the frame. Yeah, yeah, totally, totally. But these are really clarifying kind of further. That's often what they call conversational search in this fashion type of things. How this would work is Evangelist runs this as a workshop at ECIR in 2026. What do you think? Evangelist and you run this as a workshop at ECIR to build conversational search engines for life out there. But how is this a conversation? No, he should. He should. Oh yeah, totally. But how is this a conversation if there's only one party to the conversation and the output is just... You have an agent. So how I see it, but maybe it's wrong, we've been developing this kind of for very long, meaning when you started in 2006,2007 you would be doing Rokio and so on. We couldn't do better, you know what I mean? But that was already this primitive conversation with the system. The system gives you something, you label something as positive and negative, and then you go back and so on. So you're conversing in a system in a very primitive way. But the queries are fixed. They're just revealed over time. The conversation would be I give you some high level information and then you can ask whatever you want. Who's asking? You're out. We have more SD cards. I changed mine. Yes, we have more. Okay, you're a smart person. So does that mean we don't provide the data? Sometimes. I endeavor to. I think that's a different challenge. Yeah, I mean what you could do is, but this is a different... Turn it off first before you take out this deeper, please. What you could do is like, rather than prepare these list of hints, prepare like one page description of the scene you're looking for with a lot of detail. And then you could have this as an Oracle that people ask against. This is so complicated to do. It's complicated to do, yeah, because we would run that Oracle service somewhere and... I really kind of think because, you know why we shouldn't do it in case of... It's an easy IRIR challenge. It's ECIR. Yeah. And the other thing is, of course, who, I mean, if you do that based on an LLM, you couldn't ensure that the answers are exactly reproducible if different people use the Oracle. But this is essentially something that I... We use a data set to do these things. Go to CKR, go to VCR. Bring the clock to the lady. This is something I would have wanted to do as a different type of VBS task for a while. There is essentially that you would go ahead and have a volunteer show them the target beforehand and then they need to send their, okay, time to show, I describe and teams can, is it more or less, shout into, yeah, but what was this, what was that? Essentially have an ad hoc conversation for a VPS style setting, this could work. work. Yeah. For something like this. I mean, we could also do it here for the interactive part. We could also do it here. I'm a bit... In the first year, we should do it with low works. Yes. I'm a bit more hesitant for this because for if you if you do it for for vbs with something like v3c um the the possible universe of of things is so much larger that it's probably questions that are much more easy to answer quickly that's true yeah whereas somebody goes yeah but how exactly was this and then the person takes a while to answer this that's a conversational challenge rather than a retrieval challenge. We still focus on retrieval challenges. Can I just kind of try to explain? Because I don't know how much I should say because we didn't finish. We just started working with Hongi RPG. I can say about it. Hongi Wang. Hongi my PhD with the vanguards. What we started doing. Why I see it's actually conversation, can I? No, yes. But it's kind of in development stage, you know, like so I'm not sure that it works, so I don't like, so basically this is the general idea. When you formulate information need, and I think that's what you did well with VBS and LSE, when you kind of get an information need, are often not able kind of to formulate it clearly you know like or unwilling or so you want to use as short query as possible and get the relevant result you know. So we are now kind of developing some agents on both sides on retrieval and for information need and so on to handle those sites but actually what we have here is like really user that has information need but is either unwilling or unable to clearly formulate it as a very concise and detailed query so the system then retrieves something and these clarify information that came later on are there because nobody found relevant results so I think this is really good simulation of that information need and conversing"
**Leisure Activities**,2909,3674," Arš! Arš! Thank you. you you you you you you you you you you you... Automatisch? Ja. Automatic? Automatic. Yeah, it's directly with the loudspeaker. You just need to specify it. Yeah, exactly. So why not? Okay, so interactive happens at competition. Yeah. Queries are at competition. This would be guest. Qu is it going to be? We will see some of that. We can't even do instance search. Can we move? Just if I may ask, because that's kind of a huge trend in the community, that we probably shouldn't ignore, and we are almost there. Just kind of try to go just a little bit one step extra with the non-item search to kind of formulate it more as a conversational task. It is already there, so it would just take revealing partially more and more information. Can you give an example? For an example, like what I'm doing with Evangelos, for example, that's a colleague from information retrieval and this is like mostly text now but we are trying kind of to do the visual and with the Hongi and it's we set there Evangelos and I were thinking what are the good benchmarks for this kind of task multimodal conversational search and you know I told him VBS and lifebook search that's as close as it gets it doesn't exist there are data sets few data sets here and there so just to give an example so for example when you normally start revealing maybe we didn't think that way but I talked to Cajal several times about it you say for example aha I'm looking for a video Cajal says for example let's go first LSE and I'll give you VBS, you know, the same example, it's almost conversation. So Kahl says, aha our anonymous life logger was sitting in a chair, it was a home of a family member and I was looking at something on a wall and then people are looking for many things which are correct and not correct that's literally like what you do in the first round of interaction in first round of interaction conversational systems and then comes additional part of information that we sometimes keep as a ground truth like as a part of information that you are not aware of in conversational systems. And then you say, oh, it was a painting. And there was something white and red on it. So it's kind of giving you extras. So that is. Yeah, it's like our standard. And then comes, oh, those were the figures. It could be aliens, or it could be some type of information. So that's like people are developing conversational systems. Okay, we're there already. We're there already. Yeah, that's what I said. But some queries are not like that. I was just like saying when we select the queries actually to be queries that are also compatible with this. Well, all known item search queries are like that. The LSE item search queries are all like the vbc the vbs as well ad hoc find as many as we can yes they just have fewer stages yeah instant search find a single one not all of them they are kind of thinking no known item search all not not not avs but because that you don't want specify precisely, but all known item search queries are. Yeah, by known item search. Maybe we just kind of formulated slightly. Instant slash known item search. Then advertising. But then this means we would go for known item search and not for ad hoc, right? Yes. This is known item search. This is known item search. Conversational search is known item search. Yes, totally. We were discussing, but at some point you were not really persuaded that it's already conversational. It's not conversational, because conversational search, my understanding is, I say something to the system, the system has a question mark, I say something else, and there's this conversational talk. It's compatible with the conversational search. It's conversational search. Only conversational search. I mean, the other, the way, yeah, the way… It depends what kind of system people develop. No, no, we can't because the query is fixed. So if I ask you not what was on the picture, but if I ask you what color has the frame. Yeah, yeah, totally, totally.
