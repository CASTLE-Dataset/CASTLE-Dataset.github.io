I think it's kind of close. But what's the rules? What's the rules? What's the rules? It's consistent. It's a kind of air bubble now that you can't inside. Yeah, it's consistent. So, like, if you don't have to leave, you don't have to stay. Like, in her name, you'll get a meeting with you and them? Yeah, it's just consistent throughout everywhere. Really? But then it's like,, it used to be very phonetical, consistent, but now they've changed so much that we have different pronunciations that we are aware of. It's the reason why we think that we say the same thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, we're going opp oss sammen. Oh no, but here is your seat. You can go away for a moment. Always. Like him, because he is too long. Like him, because he is too long. He has two characters. He has plenty of characters. He can go over here and we can shoot him up. Yes. Okay, dessert. One, two, three. One, two, three. No, no. One moment. Thank you. Okay. I'm going to have a plate of chicken wings. Yes. I'm going to have a plate of chicken wings. Yeah, we can do a test of the chicken wings. No, no. No, no. No, no. Please don't choose the same selection of wings. Please don't choose the same selection of wings. We're trying to keep it simple with these chains. Ideally, we just have everybody having exactly the same. Ideally, we just have everybody having exactly the same. I'll leave it at that for the last time. I'll leave it at that for the last time. I'll leave it at that for the last time. I'll leave it at that for the last time. I'll leave it at that for the last time. I'll leave it at that for the last time. I'll leave it at that for the last time. I'll leave it at that for the last time. I'll leave it at that for the last time. I'm going to eat. Yeah. He doesn't want to be stopped by his friends. He's actually been very nice to me. He knows that we're good friends. He'll say, good luck. He'll say, good luck. That dessert. We have three choices. Let's try to minimize the choices. Only one. Do you want ice cream? Apple pie. That's probably the thing that's not strawberry season. So, still apple pie. Apple pie or ice cream? I want apple pie. I want ice cream. No, you can put ice cream on apple pie. Why don't we do we do a fire ice cream? Yes. What's the rush? It's after... No, we just do ice cream then. Then we go for the fire ice cream. The water. After Irish breakfast tomorrow. Followed by... I think you're done. Followed by the big job. Followed by a chicken gouda from the United States. Followed by a pie. What were they eating? A bunch of things. I'm just going to take the chicken gouda off the chair. One of them. Okay, we have to get to the 11 pieces of the food. 11 pieces. So, what we can do also is just get started up. We can just skip the second part. What else can we do? I think we skip the second and we can just do the third part. Because we have a sub-submergy. Apparently so. But starters have like 4 o'clock. That's a problem. We just have an extra meal tomorrow. That's all. How about a meal between lunch and dinner? I am... You sound like Covid, so... Second lunch tomorrow. I'm going home. Not that they argue. What about supper? What about... What about second breakfast? What about... We should have made this... What about the... Okay, so what we're going to do for dessert. Ice creams or apple pies? We can do the ice cream, that's easy. Ice cream is easy. Ice cream is very good. And easy to escape also. Somebody else will have to see the ice cream. Depends on who goes to Apple Pie. They're all in. All in. We'll go to Apple Pie. I said we can do it. Okay, Apple Pie it is. It's changed. How close is it? Don't ask me, you'll provide this. It's changed. Is that an apple pie? Please let us know. How long has it been? We asked you to make one big apple pie. It's very long. What did you do? I did a couple of accidents. I thought it was a challenge. I thought it was a challenge. I thought it was a challenge. I thought it was a challenge. I thought it was a challenge. I thought it was a challenge. I thought it was a challenge. I thought it was a challenge. I thought it was a challenge. I thought it was a challenge. I thought it was a challenge. I thought it was a challenge.

I thought it was a challenge. I thought it was a challenge. I thought it was a challenge. I thought it was a challenge. I thought it was a channel. It doesn't have to be a series of messages sometimes. It's a channel that I should contribute to you. You should just make one out of fire. No, I don't want to do that. You know, pretend I'm a studio staff to make ads. It's okay. I think they will work. No, but then I... Okay, anyway. Brandon wants me to send him a message that says, what we want this morning. So, right now we set up two people who helped me make this decision."

"The image provided depicts a kitchen setting. Based on the objects visible and the overall arrangement, the most fitting classification is **Cooking**.

Here's why:

*   **Kitchen Appliances:** The presence of a stove, oven, sink, and countertops strongly suggests cooking activities.
*   **Food Preparation Items:** While not definitively clear, the items on the island (like the pineapple) and in the sink could be related to food preparation.
*   **General Kitchen Environment:** Kitchens are primarily used for preparing and cooking food.

But then it's like,, it used to be very phonetical, consistent, but now they've changed so much that we have different pronunciations that we are aware of.

That's probably the thing that's not strawberry season. So, still apple pie. Apple pie or ice cream? I want apple pie. I want ice cream. No, you can put ice cream on apple pie. Why don't we do we do a fire ice cream? Yes. What's the rush? It's after... No, we just do ice cream then. Then we go for the fire ice cream. The water. After Irish breakfast tomorrow. Followed by... I think you're done. Followed by the big job. Followed by a chicken gouda from the United States. Followed by a pie. What were they eating? A bunch of things. I'm just going to take the chicken gouda off the chair. One of them. Okay, we have to get to the 11 pieces of the food. 11 pieces. So, what we can do also is just get started up. We can just skip the second part. What else can we do? I think we skip the second and we can just do the third part. Because we have a sub-submergy. Apparently so. But starters have like 4 o'clock. That's a problem. We just have an extra meal tomorrow. That's all. How about a meal between lunch and dinner? I am... You sound like Covid, so... Second lunch tomorrow. I'm going home. Not that they argue. What about supper? What about... What about second breakfast? What about... We should have made this... What about the... Okay, so what we're going to do for dessert. Ice creams or apple pies? We can do the ice cream, that's easy. Ice cream is easy. Ice cream is very good. And easy to escape also. Somebody else will have to see the ice cream. Depends on who goes to Apple Pie. They're all in. All in. We'll go to Apple Pie. I said we can do it. Okay, Apple Pie it is. It's changed. How close is it? Don't ask me, you'll provide this. It's changed. Is that an apple pie? Please let us know. How long has it been? We asked you to make one big apple pie. It's very long. What did you do? I did a couple of accidents.

You know, pretend I'm a studio staff to make ads. It's okay. I think they will work. No, but then I... Okay, anyway. Brandon wants me to send him a message that says, what we want this morning.

But then it's like,, it used to be very phonetical, consistent, but now they've changed so much that we have different pronunciations that we are aware of. It's the reason why we think that we say the same thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, we're going opp oss sammen. Oh no, but here is your seat. You can go away for a moment. Always.

He'll say, good luck. He'll say, good luck. That dessert. We have three choices. Let's try to minimize the choices. Only one. Do you want ice cream? Apple pie. That's probably the thing that's not strawberry season. So, still apple pie. Apple pie or ice cream? I want apple pie. I want ice cream. No, you can put ice cream on apple pie. Why don't we do we do a fire ice cream? Yes. What's the rush? It's after... No, we just do ice cream then. Then we go for the fire ice cream. The water. After Irish breakfast tomorrow. Followed by... I think you're done. Followed by the big job. Followed by a chicken gouda from the United States. Followed by a pie. What were they eating? A bunch of things. I'm just going to take the chicken gouda off the chair. One of them. Okay, we have to get to the 11 pieces of the food. 11 pieces. So, what we can do also is just get started up. We can just skip the second part. What else can we do? I think we skip the second and we can just do the third part. Because we have a sub-submergy. Apparently so. But starters have like 4 o'clock. That's a problem. We just have an extra meal tomorrow. That's all. How about a meal between lunch and dinner? I am... You sound like Covid, so... Second lunch tomorrow. I'm going home. Not that they argue. What about supper? What about... What about second breakfast? What about... We should have made this... What about the... Okay, so what we're going to do for dessert. Ice creams or apple pies? We can do the ice cream, that's easy. Ice cream is easy. Ice cream is very good. And easy to escape also. Somebody else will have to see the ice cream. Depends on who goes to Apple Pie. They're all in. All in. We'll go to Apple Pie. I said we can do it. Okay, Apple Pie it is. It's changed. How close is it? Don't ask me, you'll provide this. It's changed. Is that an apple pie? Please let us know. How long has it been? We asked you to make one big apple pie. It's very long. What did you do? I did a couple of accidents.

But then it's like,, it used to be very phonetical, consistent, but now they've changed so much that we have different pronunciations that we are aware of.

He'll say, good luck. He'll say, good luck. That dessert. We have three choices. Let's try to minimize the choices. Only one. Do you want ice cream? Apple pie. That's probably the thing that's not strawberry season. So, still apple pie. Apple pie or ice cream? I want apple pie. I want ice cream. No, you can put ice cream on apple pie. Why don't we do we do a fire ice cream? Yes. What's the rush? It's after... No, we just do ice cream then. Then we go for the fire ice cream. The water. After Irish breakfast tomorrow. Followed by... I think you're done. Followed by the big job. Followed by a chicken gouda from the United States. Followed by a pie. What were they eating? A bunch of things. I'm just going to take the chicken gouda off the chair. One of them. Okay, we have to get to the 11 pieces of the food. 11 pieces. So, what we can do also is just get started up. We can just skip the second part. What else can we do? I think we skip the second and we can just do the third part. Because we have a sub-submergy. Apparently so. But starters have like 4 o'clock. That's a problem. We just have an extra meal tomorrow. That's all. How about a meal between lunch and dinner? I am... You sound like Covid, so... Second lunch tomorrow. I'm going home. Not that they argue. What about supper? What about... What about second breakfast? What about... We should have made this... What about the... Okay, so what we're going to do for dessert. Ice creams or apple pies? We can do the ice cream, that's easy. Ice cream is easy. Ice cream is very good. And easy to escape also. Somebody else will have to see the ice cream. Depends on who goes to Apple Pie. They're all in. All in. We'll go to Apple Pie. I said we can do it. Okay, Apple Pie it is. It's changed. How close is it? Don't ask me, you'll provide this. It's changed. Is that an apple pie? Please let us know. How long has it been? We asked you to make one big apple pie. It's very long. What did you do? I did a couple of accidents.

You know, pretend I'm a studio staff to make ads. It's okay. I think they will work. No, but then I... Okay, anyway. Brandon wants me to send him a message that says, what we want this morning.

That's probably the thing that's not strawberry season. So, still apple pie. Apple pie or ice cream? I want apple pie. I want ice cream. No, you can put ice cream on apple pie. Why don't we do we do a fire ice cream? Yes. What's the rush? It's after... No, we just do ice cream then. Then we go for the fire ice cream. The water. After Irish breakfast tomorrow. Followed by... I think you're done. Followed by the big job. Followed by a chicken gouda from the United States. Followed by a pie. What were they eating? A bunch of things. I'm just going to take the chicken gouda off the chair. One of them. Okay, we have to get to the 11 pieces of the food. 11 pieces. So, what we can do also is just get started up. We can just skip the second part. What else can we do? I think we skip the second and we can just do the third part. Because we have a sub-submergy. Apparently so. But starters have like 4 o'clock. That's a problem. We just have an extra meal tomorrow. That's all. How about a meal between lunch and dinner? I am... You sound like Covid, so... Second lunch tomorrow. I'm going home. Not that they argue. What about supper? What about... What about second breakfast? What about... We should have made this... What about the... Okay, so what we're going to do for dessert. Ice creams or apple pies? We can do the ice cream, that's easy. Ice cream is easy. Ice cream is very good. And easy to escape also. Somebody else will have to see the ice cream. Depends on who goes to Apple Pie. They're all in. All in. We'll go to Apple Pie. I said we can do it. Okay, Apple Pie it is. It's changed. How close is it? Don't ask me, you'll provide this. It's changed. Is that an apple pie? Please let us know. How long has it been? We asked you to make one big apple pie. It's very long. What did you do? I did a couple of accidents.

You know, pretend I'm a studio staff to make ads. It's okay. I think they will work. No, but then I... Okay, anyway. Brandon wants me to send him a message that says, what we want this morning.

That's probably the thing that's not strawberry season. So, still apple pie. Apple pie or ice cream? I want apple pie. I want ice cream. No, you can put ice cream on apple pie. Why don't we do we do a fire ice cream? Yes. What's the rush? It's after... No, we just do ice cream then. Then we go for the fire ice cream. The water. After Irish breakfast tomorrow. Followed by... I think you're done. Followed by the big job. Followed by a chicken gouda from the United States. Followed by a pie. What were they eating? A bunch of things. I'm just going to take the chicken gouda off the chair. One of them. Okay, we have to get to the 11 pieces of the food. 11 pieces. So, what we can do also is just get started up. We can just skip the second part. What else can we do? I think we skip the second and we can just do the third part. Because we have a sub-submergy. Apparently so. But starters have like 4 o'clock. That's a problem. We just have an extra meal tomorrow. That's all. How about a meal between lunch and dinner? I am... You sound like Covid, so... Second lunch tomorrow. I'm going home. Not that they argue. What about supper? What about... What about second breakfast? What about... We should have made this... What about the... Okay, so what we're going to do for dessert. Ice creams or apple pies? We can do the ice cream, that's easy. Ice cream is easy. Ice cream is very good. And easy to escape also. Somebody else will have to see the ice cream.

We call it cross. Yeah, so basically that's the card. So, Ruman is highest part. Ruman. Yeah, so is the water, but it's really called Ace. Ace. And, this one means... So this one beats this one, beats this one, beats this one, beats this one, yeah? And then we have, um... Let's say we have a... I don't know how to call it in English, but we have a Choker color. So that means, in the beginning, we select which color is the Choker and this fits the other colors. So for example, if this would be the Joker color, then this would be the Joker race. Okay. And then there is another rule, the only very specific rule. We will have the four immovable cards, so the king and the queen. This it the queen? Yeah, it can be. It's not really the queen, but... Okay. Yeah, I call it queen now. Then if you have one of them of the joker color, then it counts 40, but you need to play it. Do you need to play one of them and say 40? And if you have one of them not Joker colors, like this one from CrossFit, then you know he has 20. Or you can do something. He has 20 from the normal colors, but he uses the Joker color and he has 40. Okay, but it's two cards. So you have to give me the cards that you say you have. Yeah. CrossFit. Yeah. When you play this, you have the character that you say is great if you play play with it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, but you have to play like this. You have the cards and then you say, wait, can you play one of them? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, it's very simple actually. So let's try it. We want to pick at five cards. And the goal is to play for 65. Okay. So let's see. Okay, so we start. Normally you do like that. Okay. And then I give you three. And then I select the top color. It It's leaf or green. But it's a chopper and we always... It's a photo part of the neck that we brought from the first. And we chop out the leaf now is the chopper color. We start playing a card. I think you can play a card. You can play a card and I try to hit it with a fire card. Oh, you should not play the Joker card. You should not do that. Because I do not have to hit, so I could give you a very low number. So let's move to this. Yeah, so for example. So if you, with these cards... Oh, by the way, this is another special rule. If you have the Joker's lowest card. The lowest? The lowest, yeah, because it's the two points card. Yeah, but I hope this is the fourth one, no? No, no, this is the fourth. This is the fourth, this is the... I have to remember that I have to remember that. Yeah, this is the king, you see? This is the king. I don't know how you can recognize this queen. But it's not a queen, it's a body of a horse. Is it a horse or is it a horse? That's it. I don't know how to call that in English. I don't know. Horse. Yeah. Is it a horse? This is the horse or is it a car? Is it a... Is it a glass? three points are Because here we have two, this is a... This is the same, like the two ones. Yeah, also, it has gloves. Like gloves. How do we actually distinguish this? This is the ace, right? This is the ace. This is the open. This is the same here. Ace also. Now, ace is two. Ace always has these four signs. Ah, yes. This is the eight. Yeah. And I don't know actually... Three, two right? Yeah, two. Two, two. Maybe the location of this... Yeah, maybe that one. Exactly, you're right. Here you need exactly one. Here is the sign. The card is here and it's green. And this one is green. Except, yeah, I made it a little bit more red. Good. And with the mirror. The mirror is white. Oh. There it's still very nice. The building is a bit old, but it's still very nice. The building is a bit old, but it's still very nice. The building is a bit old, but it's still very nice.

But I only can count if I make some hits. For example, if you play this move, right? So this is the 4. This is the 3. I can select if I hit them with the King or with the 10. It's up to me. I would go with the use of the pen. Because now, if I put it here, I have 30 points. If I would use this one, I would only have 7 points. Then if you get the ace, you know, and then you can hit me here with that card. If you have an ace in this card, it's 21. You understand? If you draw a card and it gets, let's say you get somewhere, you get the ace. When do we get a card? After every play, after every round. Oh, wow. Can we play one more game? Yeah, yeah, okay. So let's say, and now... Okay, okay, so you play a card. Yes, I play one. And this one? Yes, and I would use that one to hit it, right? So that's it for my card. I hit first because I made a hit. So I put not very much card. That's a ticket one. Yeah, yeah. And then you go here. Okay, no, no, I am on... That's really something... Okay, because I made a hit. So I would probably play something like... I don't know. If I don't know if you have the ace of that, I will draw on... Yeah. I will... You could play that one or this one. How about if it's an equal? Yeah, this one because it's two points. And you, what you can do is you can hit it with the same color... Oh, you can play this one? Yeah, it's on my side. You can give me this and then I will put it to my deck and it's 4 points for me. But you could hit it with the same color. Can I give this again with you? No, you can give this to me because it's not the same color. Ah, so I have to be the same color. Yes. So you can hit it with the... But I can hit with this one, right? Yes, exactly. Can I hit with this one also? Absolutely. But it makes sense to keep the joker cards until the end. Because when you want to draw even more cards... I had for example aces. You could hit aces with this card, you know? Or in other know? Or, in other words, it makes sense to hit very high cards with some token cards. But also, if you keep that one, you might get the 3-point card in your safe. And you go to get 65 points. So, if you have the Chotter of the King and the War of the to... It's like human being. Yeah. You know this. Yeah. But this would be very stupid. Because in which place the job at work. So it becomes... Yeah. Okay. It is in your... Yes.

Well, there should also be a bottle of white wine. I don't know how to do that. I usually would do mushroom cream sauce with wine and onion otherwise. Luca, there is half a bottle of wine left from the risotto. Yeah, but there's another. But you wanted that for baking? There's one and a half bottles. Yeah, but you wanted the one for the baking? No, not for baking, for the stew, that's not happening because the new one's better. I don't put wine in a mushroom so I wouldn't, but if you say it's better, then I do it. No, it's fine. Well, the way I would have done the stew, well, the Gischnetze, it essentially is on the cream sauce. And where are the crank bags as well? That's not ideal. It's essentially you fry the mushrooms and the onions. You put in the white wine, reduce it down, put in the green, reduce it down, you get the sauce."

Where is it at the competition? Where is it? I'm just trying to go a little bit, a step extra with the non-item search. More as a. It is already there, so it would just take a little bit partially more information. For example, like what I'm doing with I don't know. information. For example, I didn't pay for a video. I got out of this, for example, I got a little bit of a stress in my face. But the same example, it's almost congestion. So I kind of said, aha, our news life order was sitting in a chair. It was home of family member. And I will be in a role. if we're moving in many things, we are correct, we make up correct, we do a lot of moving, we do a lot of interaction, we do a lot of interaction with the traditional systems, then comes additional problem, we sometimes keep this in common with the traditional systems, and then you say, oh, it was a painting, There was something like a.... could be dailies or could be sub-dialogues. So that's like the people are developing propositional systems. Sometimes, I'm not like that. I would just like to say the queries actually could be queries that are also compatible. You see how like all the language queries are like that? The scene on edge and such queries are all like same. Sometimes they are rotated. Adhoc finds as many as we have. Yes, the D-Works agency. Insta-search finds as many as we have. Not in ABS, but because that... They have all the identified of formulated slightly. But then it would be for search, not for. Yes. This is search. This is not. Operational search is not line research. We were discussing that at some point you were not really persuading the conversation. It's not conversational because conversational search, my understanding is, I say something to the system, just my own question, I say something else and this is conversational talk. We can't evaluate the conversation. It's pseudo-conversational search. What do you mean conversational search? It depends what kind of system people develop. No, we can't because the query is fixed. So if I ask you not what was on the picture, but if I ask you what color has the gray, Yeah, totally, totally. These are really clarifying. That's all from the search and discussion. How this would work is evangelist runs this at the workshop at ECI. Evangelist, you run this at the workshop at ECI. You build conversations with search engines for life.
