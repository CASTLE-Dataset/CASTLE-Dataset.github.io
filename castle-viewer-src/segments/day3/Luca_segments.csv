Not sure they realized. But I pressed it well. Also on the other house? No. No. I thought not. I heard people like this morning, I thought they were awake already. Okay. Those who come latest must wash. Good idea. I fear we're gonna run out of orange juice. Good morning boss. I had to milk the cows, sorry. Good afternoon. First Luca has to check if this is in order. Am I recording something? It is blinking. Have you set it to video rather than time-lapse? I have no idea. Can you check that? It would have been easier to check before you started. Can I stop it? Who wants cornflakes? You are too tall. It is very difficult to actually see what you're doing that looks reasonable probably correct probably correct probably correct I'm eating breakfast okay it's fine Boss, milk, banya, proper milk, not this old plant-based school of science. We're going to be cancelled by the vegan community. The vegan community will look at this and they will cancel it straight away. 24 sausages. Yeah. I mean, technically, you cannot milk an almond, so. Not with that attitude attitude Everybody here is going to be comfortable So is this the video mode? Yes This video? Yes And what I shouldn't do is kind of touch it What you should not do is either this Or this Ah there are only three modes Yes Do you know what we talked yesterday? I think I just touched it with my finger. Mm-hmm. It doesn't take much. You just need to pay attention to it beeping. Yeah, I think we were cooking, or either when I went to home, or God knows. I was working on my step count, probably, on the camera now, I'll see you later. I guess we'll be here. Probably. Somebody will be somewhere. I think it's all Klaus's fault. Yeah, why? Yeah, why? I don't know. It's always fault of the audience. I think next castle we should buy like a treadmill so that people can exercise. Yeah, I'm okay with that. We should buy things that we need for castle. Buy a castle. I would love to it. See, I have the money, right? To buy a castle? Can I tell you something honestly, very honestly? Like the amount of money that you spent for this, everybody's gonna say, oh my god, you know, like it costs a lot. No, actually, I'm gonna tell you the opposite. And I'll is super cheap. It's super cheap. You know what kind of nonsensical stuff boards of the universities spend time on? It's like what kind of nonsensical positions, you know, like our overhead is 50%. Where does that thing go? You know what's 50%? Yes, sir. Every 2 euro that you bring for adapt, 1 euro goes somewhere else. And that's pretty much across the universities, you know, happened with this was it's not going for these experiments you know because we don't have any of them we are just so many people we got a 10 000 euro grant from we asked for money to apply somebody and they said, no, go away and have a workshop. So, 10,000 euros. And I went to the Radisson Hotel in the city centre and would have been 8 or 9,000 euros just to put us up in rooms for three days. Before we have food. Before we fly people in. Exactly, yes. So I had to make this case to the university because I was booking a holiday home. The travel agent refused to book it multiple times. First of all because it was on Airbnb, secondly because it was a holiday home. I had to provide evidence in advance before I booked it to the university and for them to say it was okay.

Like healthcare that can be planned and that excludes cosmetic treatments and such. Basically essential stuff that can be planned. That doesn't have to happen this second.

Maybe that we are going to see later from some anthropology, or some agent people. Humans are agent people. I people. Many people working with agents and so on. Like CBMI keynote if you've seen it. So we are highly attuned as humans to analyze human face. That's why we are so good in recognizing faces and emotions and everything. And you know, most people that have hair do something with their hair. You do something with your curls every morning. You may be a curly boss, but a curly boss also has hair. And Klaus also, you know, like we cut hair and everything. So now you've got, meaning I don't have any hair yet, like, too much buzz cut.

Sitting,2611,2647," yesterday Bjorn wanted the fish but you want to know what fish it was first and wanted to know the name in Latin oh yes that's what he said the genus of the fish I probably gotten probably getting the name in Irish. And the species. Yeah. In Irish. In Irish, yes. I don't know. Okay, so... The transcription of this is going to be hilarious. Okay, so Bjorn wanted to know what type of fish. I don't know if I'll be able to find that out. never fish is in the freezer mmm freezer fish it's like an Arctic species they haven't they haven't cooked in many months they're turning on the ovens just for us jennifer organized it and who's gonna cook it god knows because and i guess the chef last night yeah there's no chef the barman will cook this one is there yeah who i think it's the husband brendan anyway that's who I have to message very soon with the... Who is I am sure a classically trained chef? He's definitely able to pour a good Guinness. So that's half the battle. I would really prefer it if the lady from two nights ago, when we were cooking, she seems capable with all sorts of... Yes, and I think her husbandops. But that's not the owner of this place. The owner is somebody else. Ah, okay. Maybe that's not her husband. If they look alike, that does not mean that... No, the problem is beyond that. It's a small village. A husband and wife can look alike. Oh wow. Cancels? Yeah, and this is how you're getting cancelled. I don't know why it's wrong with this one. Okay, is it wrong? It's wrong. It's not wrong? Yes. In 20 years time it will be very wrong. You should feel bad. When some two-year-old right now is doing a PhD, when he made a sense, when... 27, 20 years ago. Oh, look what he said. The population will have collapsed so much by that point. This is also a cultural heritage, he just said. It is. It will be. It's a snapshot in time of things that we cannot say anymore. That we shouldn't have said now, probably. But it's too late for that. I never sat in for that kind of joke. What do they look like? I meant partners start looking alike. Yes, that is. Of course. What else do you think? Yes, that is. Does mother in law want a steak or not? She wants a steak. She said it many times yesterday. That means we have nine steaks, one chicken, goujons right? Can I just have steak? One chicken goujon. Maybe just have steak. Awww. Okay, okay. You misunderstand how steak works. The more steak, there's only so many pans. The more steak, the more steak, the more steak. I'm gonna put new sheath. You know, it's really strange what a proportional relationship this is. Okay, I've got to contact him.

Who is I am sure a classically trained chef? He's definitely able to pour a good Guinness. So that's half the battle. I would really prefer it if the lady from two nights ago, when we were cooking, she seems capable with all sorts of... Yes, and I think her husbandops. But that's not the owner of this place.

It's It's almost perfectly correlated. Everybody's best is both. Put the sheet on. Okay, let's do it. Almost perfectly. If you're taking goujons, it's okay. Okay. Because Bjorn wants a certain type of fish. Which he's not going to get because they only have a different kind of fish. Whatever is in the freezer fish. Or maybe somebody goes fishing just for... Look, he doesn't cook this time of year, so year So whatever he gets us outside of the normal is gonna be whatever is in the supermarket So my suggestion is just have it steak Steak is always available all year round I just feel like we had very heavy food every day My concern is he's not going to go to get fresh fish from somewhere he's just going to get the fish that's available which is probably in super value but you mean the meat will be fresh the meat will be fresh in the butchers because there's a butcher's in town there's not a fishmonger in town is there a fishmonger in town you already graduated you can't do anything about it just pick whatever you want yes i'm just giving you recommendations"

Gradually, you know, getting shorter one end and the middle is expanding, so like in the end it won't be the same country. But I'm sure there's like one politician saying, look, we have a lot of immigration, so we're making more room for... Look at our great policy, vote for us. Nobody has ever been that creative. Well... Like the most creative... This is not trying hard enough. The most creative slogan that we had was a really old party that kind of... It was a middle party, so it used to be sort of a default vote if you were a little bit fed off with your wing then you can migrate to them and then their slogan was like why not just vote for us mm-hmm if you have nothing better to do really worked uh-huh they got the really good election based on this look sure You know, a few years ago. Okay. They got pretty decimated this time. Það verði verið. Það var ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki ekki change that I recall ever. Okay, from what to what? So, it's hard to tell because we have so many political parties. But, let's say, social democrats... Which I would argue is a good thing. You want more of them. To an extent. Yeah. I mean, if you have 63 people and you have... Now we have six political parties. you know, there were three that didn't get anybody into Congress because they were too small, basically. So they were below. Six is not that many. Yeah. But it's, you know, so it depends on the distribution. I think it's really good to not have a single party in power. Yes. Three can be unwieldy. But they also do... If you don't think there are more than two actually decent parties, then you're also in trouble, right? Well, but that's the whole point, right? If different people think different parties are decent but if you only have the two, then you say well, I don't like that one and I don't like that one either, but I like that one slightly less, so I'm going to vote for the other one. I think the binary system is the worst. Yeah, no, no. So I think I think six years recently Það er ekki verið. Það er ekki verið. Það er ekki verið son, he's like, you know, you always find your point of reference. If it's the last poll done before the election... Could have been worse! Yeah, it could have been worse, exactly. It's like Iceland beating Cyprus 1-0 and not being at the bottom of the qualification group and then singing we are not the worst. That's what we do often at Eurovision. We never know that the Germans are still behind us. We finally got over that one year where Switzerland got zero points across the board Yeah, this it's going to be in Basel. Yes The the city is gonna pay for it Which is gonna be interesting I mean, I assume they're gonna make it back in taxes on tourists and stuff, but... Yeah, but I mean, it's fine, because they have this big event center thing that has been being renovated for years and years and years, and it's way over budget way behind schedule and so and now they finally have a Proper forcing function. No, it needs to be done You make it happen Basically there was a shift of like 24 people. Out of? So if you add the pluses and the minuses for all the parties, it's 24 out of 63. Okay. So that's a fairly fair number of changes. Okay, so over a third. And I think the odds on favourites for the government will not include any of the old government. Mm-hmm"

"Based on the visual information in the provided images, the segment can be classified as **Leisure Activities**.

Here's why:

*   **Presence of a Christmas Tree:** The visible Christmas tree strongly suggests a festive or holiday period, which is often associated with leisure and relaxation.
*   **Person Waving:** The man in the images is waving, which is a social gesture often associated with greeting someone or signaling a friendly interaction, aligning with leisure or social activities.
*   **General Home Environment:** The setting appears to be a home, with elements like a kitchen and a living area visible, suggesting a personal or relaxed environment rather than a work-related or task-specific one.
*   **Other Person on Laptop:** In one image, another person is seen on a laptop, which can be for work, but in the context of a home and what appears to be a relaxed atmosphere, it could also be for personal use or leisure.

While other activities might be happening in the background, the overall impression and the most prominent observable actions point towards a leisure-oriented context.",3134,3137, Beep.

With some water under it? And then what? With some water under it to... Something, well, I don't know exactly what kind of ham it is. But this is smoked. This goes bad very slowly. What? The ham is good still. Your camera is not doing anything. No, sorry. I went into my... So this ham, in your opinion, we have to open it. I don't know we I have not seen I mean the ham is vacuum sealed I have no reason to assume the ham would be bad the ham should the ham should be fine the ham should be fine so then-cooked. The ham should be fine."
Discussing,279,430," Yeah, but is it enough for it well, maybe We can do ham and potatoes for dinner, then we just do roast potatoes and... And mushrooms, you know what we can do? We're going to go and buy them, put them in a pot. No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Stop buying stuff. Because just buying stuff does not fix the issue because then we have other stuff to throw away. Look, I'm starting to get annoyed by the lack of organization. Two kilograms of ham for tonight. Put potatoes. We can do it. Slice some mushrooms. We can make goulash of mushrooms. So it's gonna be potato, ham, and mushrooms on top? I wouldn't goulash the mushrooms. I would just grill or fry the mushrooms. No, not just happy to go and get them. No, because then we have other stuff. Because we have to troll get the beef and a load of chicken because the old load went off. We don't have enough meat for the rest of the... Well, what else do we need then? We have the... We have 12 sausages if you will. We've got two packets of bacon yeah but yeah but that's still a lot for what for not not enough for what for for breakfast tomorrow and lunch and dinner oh no there's no no there's no dinner tomorrow. And lunch is lasagna. Lunch is what? Dude, just like breakfast. Lunch is lasagna. Breakfast, we have a bunch of other stuff we can prepare for breakfast. Everything is tomorrow for breakfast. Everything, there is cheese. We have cake. I still have some cookies to make. Complex. Okay, maybe we don't have to go. Then we don't get to go to the store.

**Talking**,430,572," Just do roast potatoes, something like this. Sauce? No, no, no. I'm going to make mushrooms in a pot. Slice them, make a goulash sauce with garlic and onions. I would just half-fry them, but if you want to... It's more like a sauce, like you take it like mushroom sauce for... Sure, if you want. We can make it for you. For the ham, it's good? It's wonderful, Almost like for a steak. Or medallions. Pork medallions. Yes, well, different... Sure. If you know what to do... Yeah, but this is not... It's not hard to turn this into something edible. It's really just the... Okay, what are the things that we have left? And, I mean, this is what annoys me, right? We spent a lot of time putting together lists and preparing this, and then people just do whatever. And then we have to constantly say, oh, no, but this was used up for this other thing. That's like, these things, don't worry. It takes a while to learn. Whenever we go like for a week on a boat, I figured out one thing you can never go wrong with. Lots of rice, lots of pasta. Yeah, that's... No, but that's not the point. Then we buy lots of aubergine. Things that cannot go bad. Even mushrooms are dangerous. Like you go with aubergine, it tastes tastes not good, you know, like outside. Every second day we do it this way, that way. Stuff the fridge with the cheese, serve it with cheese. We use a lot of these grilled cheese, there's cheese, there's cheese. Hams and breakfast, we don't overdo. Breakfast, we kind of just do it as a total spread. Yes, but again, for breakfast, right? We even have stuff that we can use up for breakfast. We have some puff pastry. We have various fruits. We can have a fruit pie that we just do with all the leftover fruit. It's not going to feed everyone, but it's going to be one more thing for breakfast. We have so many things. Yes, but that's exactly what I'm saying."

There is half a bottle of wine left from the risotto. Yeah, but there's another... But you wanted that for baking? There's one and a half bottles. No, not for baking. For the stew that's not happening because the wheel went bad. I don't put wine in mushrooms, so I wouldn't. But if you say it's better, then we do.

Basically goulash when I make it. There should also be a bottle of white wine. I don't know how to do that. I would do mushroom cream sauce with wine and onion otherwise. There is half a bottle of wine left from the risotto. Yeah, but there's another... But you wanted that for baking? There's one and a half bottles. No, not for baking. For the stew that's not happening because the wheel went bad. I don't put wine in mushrooms, so I wouldn't. But if you say it's better, then we do. Well, the way I would have done the stew, well, the Geschnetzeltes, it essentially is on the cream sauce. We are out of fresh ideal It's essentially you Fry the mushrooms and the onions You you put in the The white wine reduce it down put in the cream reduce it down You get in the cream, reduce it down, you get a sauce."

"The image depicts a bathroom with a toilet, sink, and mirror. This setting is primarily associated with personal hygiene and the use of toilet facilities. Considering the provided categories, none directly describe the act of using a toilet or sink for personal hygiene. However, if we interpret ""Washing dishes"" as a broader category of ""washing,"" then ""Washing dishes"" might be considered a very distant analogy. But in the absence of a more fitting category, it's best to acknowledge that the primary activity associated with this room is not explicitly listed.

Given the options, and acknowledging the limitations, **Washing dishes** is the closest category if interpreted very broadly as ""washing oneself"" or ""personal hygiene"". However, it is important to note that this is not a direct or accurate classification of the scene.

* **Visual Cues:** The video shows a person actively engaged in activities typically associated with cooking. This includes:
    * **Preparation:** Chopping or preparing ingredients on a countertop.
    * **Appliances:** The presence of a stove and possibly other cooking appliances.
    * **Utensils and Equipment:** Visible cooking utensils, bowls, or dishes.
    * **Focus and Activity:** The person's posture and engagement suggest they are concentrating on a task related to food preparation.

"**Leisure Activities**

While the image depicts individuals in a kitchen setting, their attire and the presence of what appear to be VR headsets suggest an activity beyond ordinary meal preparation. The focus seems to be on an engaging, possibly virtual, experience rather than a practical chore. Therefore, ""Leisure Activities"" is the most fitting category.",128,129," And the experts is good enough, I see."
Leisure Activities,129,135, Okay.
Cooking,135,136,
Leisure Activities,136,137, Put yourself in the middle of the conference next year.
Talking,137,138, Okay?
"The video segment provided appears to depict a group of people in a kitchen, some of whom are wearing head-mounted cameras. One individual is actively engaged in what looks like cooking, stirring something in a pot on the stove. The overall context suggests a social gathering where food preparation is taking place.

Therefore, the most fitting classification for this segment is **Cooking**.",138,139,
Meeting,139,140, There is a grand challenge session.
Cooking,140,892," We'll be involved in a grand challenge session somehow, right?"
Making Coffee,892,991," so if i look at this multimedia grand challenges there is this i believe longest running one uh i don't know how they call it social media prediction or something like that it started with the this is jd.com i don't know who sponsored it there is even significant money involved involved there. And there are teams, does anybody know that one? No. It's pretty large at AC Multimedia and it's been running for like maybe I will say five to ten years already and they always have two, three, like they have a leaderboard somehow beforehand you know so it's asynchronous but also they have different ones one is like uh social media prediction that's like something like about popularity of the media like uh mostly marketing type of task you know and the other one is i don't know something but they clearly have separate kind of scoring mechanisms and so on can you check how many grand challenges there were this year year. Something in the order of 10-ish. Should be on the website. 10-ish? I mean the typical Grand Challenge is asynchronous, right? Where you do all the evaluation in advance. Deepfake detection. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Yeah, there's a lot of ground charges. Check with them. Yeah, I think if you try to make the interactive part during the current challenge track of the conference, it has two disadvantages, I think, in the sense that you don't treat the challenges in the same way how you allocate the time budget that's one thing and the other thing is as you said you want to present leaderboard or results you don't know that or just know it five minutes before so if you do that in a workshop session before then you could have these things and maybe you, I don't know, that's proceedings-wise, this is a logistics question, because you might want to update the paper. But then logistically, it would be three independent things. Right, and you say, well, there is a classic entry into a Grand Challenge track that just presents Grand Challenge things, whatever. There might be a non-archival workshop that happens on the day before to actually do the interactive part of the experiment. And there is a sub-session in the demo track that has the things that just opens this up to everybody. And then it fits neatly in all the categories"
Leisure Activities,991,1194," we need to have an associated workshop. That's part of the workshop. Also for synchronous, we need a workshop. Well, it doesn't even necessarily need to be a proper workshop, workshop with separate calls and da-da-da. It's still part of the grand challenge. We just essentially need to have a room booked During the the workshop part of the conference so it doesn't interfere with I think it's like using the word workshop is probably Bring confusion with Yes, but MSC is We try to get LSE is a workshop. Yes, but LSE is only then as an actual... We tried to get LSE as a special session, a permanent special session. And there was pushback from ACM. But it's not a challenge. I mean, it's just a workshop. But we would need publications. Yes, but the publications would go into the Grand Challenge. Yes. The workshop don't need publications, it just needs a room. That's true. I mean the only thing is if you want to update your paper after the interactive session, then the proceedings would need to come after the conference. You're not... No, no, no. With MMM, not possible. There's no need to do that. But also for the grant, well, hmm, are all the... Yeah, exactly, yeah. So, it could be an archive paper. If you know the location of the results beforehand, you could basically put it into any paper. Yeah, but if you want the proceedings available at the start of the conference, the workshop would technically happen after. To actually replace those papers with upgraded versions. Talk very nicely to them. Not needed. You know why not needed? We could do the same as you do for MMM, for example. And then after this is done, because kind of MMM has this deal with TOM traditionally, we go for a TOM paper, kind of with everybody who participated as an... Okay, you don't like... That's already... Yeah, yeah. Tom paper with everybody who participated as an author, like it't like The paper with everybody who participated as an outer like it's gonna be paper with lots of filters No, no, I think it's great the only thing is that you already over know it with the other papers We we have results of the asynchronous run for the paper writing. Yeah, so we have that It It's just the interactive element that's problematic. I mean, what we can say is that a requirement to participate in the interactive part is to... Well, let me finish my sentence. The requirement to participate in the interactive part part is to participate in the same subtasks for the non-interactive. Because then your stuff is going to be evaluated beforehand. And then also you can do the, by the way, we also do this live. And then it can still be, it's archived sometime, somehow, whatever, later."
Leisure Activities,1194,1676, Yes.
Cooking,1676,1778," So some corruption, high-level corruption caught on camera. Very good, very good. Very good. No, it's not that. No, no, it's called bribery, sorry. No, these people already understand how these challenges run. So they will actually be able to. No, because... Mintriot takes part in LSE and VBS. He understands. Minson Dow understands. Who's the other person? I don't know. I think only two. I'm trying to check. Graham is... Just finding the webpage is not particularly mobile. No, it's not on the page yet. These things are not on the web page yet. We have a magic internal document that has all the names. Those are not published yet. We don't need the web chair, we just need a backend to actually publish stuff to this. I'm happy that we done enough we can we can summarize this again tomorrow morning make sure everybody's on the same page no figure out a hackathon there too there were more things on the agenda butcher or whatever hackathon what was on the agenda for today technically was figure out also the older the data augmentation things which would feed into the hackathon plus all the collections for now we know the set of sensors we have now what what would we want to do for any future iterations?"

"The video segment shows a person in a kitchen, actively involved in food preparation. They are seen using a pot on a stove and handling various ingredients and utensils. This clearly indicates the activity of **Cooking**.",1866,2148," Let's assume that Castle 1 has not been a disaster. It's been very successful. Except... chicken. With the exception of the second fridge. So far the second fridge was the biggest fail. I realise the brand is called Hotpoint, so why do we expect it to get... I feel they did not understand the assignment. I think for Castle 2 it would be great to have less of a focus on food. And preparation of food and logistics of food. But that's what brings us all together. I feel like, I mean, it can certainly be an aspect. I feel like it's been exaggerated this time around. A little bit too much. It's perfect for the hackathon. Maybe just one dinner a day. Again, do take-outs. Yeah, they do take-outs for the rest. I mean, ideally, there would just be more people, and then you would have fewer people in per... You would have a smaller fraction of people involved in the whole... But then the cooking organization is going to be messy with the shopping place. No, because then you would have people who are explicitly in charge of things which we did not have. Oh, yeah, everybody does something. But the people who do the shopping and the people who actually do the cooking are not the same people and information gets lost along the way and nobody knows what's going on. I think we did a good job, right? We have almost everything we need. We have almost everything, right? Well, I would... What are you saying that we should should do i would argue the whole thing was well done but there is a comma in there i would say very well okay the people didn't get the joke it's fine i got it so well done just as an example how do we do it on a boat? Very light breakfast, in a sense, spreads cheese. We could do lighter breakfast, a large breakfast. Then lunch is really cooking. Evenings we always do in a restaurant. You are aware that this is not a boat. This has different boundary conditions. If we had gone to a restaurant every night, we would have added an extra 3 or 4 thousand euros to the cost. Yeah, no, no. We couldn on our own on our own budget yeah yeah i mean the other logistics here is there is no restaurant nearby that's open every night that's why we chose this castle because it was so far from everyone there's nowhere to go right there is another i mean another option this is basically if it's possible to add a couple of people who do some of the cooking. Just to the cooking. Just to the cooking. So that would be one option. Cooking helpers. Yes. But... But that's also that process you'll see later on is also valuable as a data. So... Absolutely. Absolutely. So you do not want... The disagreements as part of it is all part of the data set. No, but the thing is that just the whole everybody does everything somehow and nobody's responsible for anything and nobody's in charge and nobody knows what's going on because everybody does everything. If we had Alice here, we'd all be on time, right? Alice wouldn't make it, right? Possibly. We just need... Get over there. So basically you're saying that's actually a point, you need the manager. You need the manager. Essentially. Yes, taking care of the logistics, of the details, of all the goings on. You need a Jennifer to organise in advance, you need an Alice to organise over here, or equivalent. Or something that floats over. Okay. But also maybe slightly less emphasis on cooking and some better organisation. So that's a couple of points. And what about technical aspects? But actually, from now, maybe the hardware could be... This wasn't too bad, right? Yeah. It's not too bad. I thought it would be worse. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's worked really well. Middle of the day, my head was hurting quite a bit, but it's getting better. But that was something else. That was the second... Yeah, well, I think the... No, but I mean, yeah, it's... It's... It's decent, it's not great, right? So there... No, no. I have no complaints. We were stuck with what we already happened to have in a closet in DC. We didn't have the budget. If ACM gave us 20,000 next time or 30,000, sure, we'd do something much nicer. Yeah. We made it work. 40,000. 50,000. That's one. Just a comment about what Björn said about the cooking. I think it's a good idea to have dedicated people cooking, but after thinking about it, I think it's very nice that we had here so many different dishes done by different people and we could look up them later on and also it's a lot about life, right? Yes, no, absolutely. So I would clearly vote against the catering aspect of it. But it needs, in general, I mean, we had very little in terms of an agenda, which in some aspects gives people the freedom to do this, there needs to be more agenda, like in general. And people behind the scenes are making sure that the agenda can actually happen. Because now everybody who runs around doing things is also... So there's no behind the scenes support. You need a production crew."
"The image shows an oven with a digital display showing ""09:07"". This suggests a time, and ovens are used for cooking. Therefore, the most appropriate classification for this segment is **Cooking**.",2148,2188," For a lot of things. Also for various setup-y things. That just takes time and resources that we did not really have this time around. So, essentially, if there were the option to do this with a larger crowd of people in a larger location, it would probably make sense to... What are you thinking? Go back to the schedule we had from three months ago we didn't implement. Everything was half an hour blocks. For this half an hour, you're playing chess. But it doesn't need to be half an hour blocks and for this half an hour you're playing chess but it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't need it doesn't need to be it doesn't need to be half an hour blocks but but essentially really um clear and strict assignments as in look we have a we have a workshop part this is this time window we have lunch lunch always happens at this time which necessitates this time block before and it's those people those really know what they're gonna have but everything There's just like checklists and stuff This time is dinner this necessitates this distance But it did not really it wasn't really Implemented like this because oh, yeah, but let's do this in our aid. Oh, no, let's swap these two things. Oh, no, let's do this. That is actually okay, because we are still having our workshop. Life is also chaotic sometimes. Yeah, but this is not supposed to be life. This is supposed to... If we had had an Alice equivalent here, with a checkbox saying, okay, you have to cook now. It's time to cook cook that would have been okay it's also means if you had somebody who could basically run up to the store or drive off to the yes so some some some some fixers essentially basically yeah so so what do we need for tomorrow yeah like if one of us had been a one of us three had been a helper, not a participant, this was fine."
**Cooking**,2188,2191," who's actually on top of everything that's happening. And that basically has authority over the participants. Yes. I think that's kind of the... When you're taking part in experiments and having authority, it's a problem. And also if there's no clear schedule, it is also difficult to coordinate things. Because then it's, oh, I need to take care of my email. I might as well do this now because nothing's going on. And then people disappear at random points in time because there's no coordination between them. And also, if you say, oh, well, now we could do this. And then, oh, but three people are missing. Okay, now then we can't. It just spirals, right?"

Discussing,2531,2538," I guess this whole thing was very, was much more ad hoc than it ideally would have been, which is fine. It was built with much less budget than it has any right to work with. For which, yeah, so far so good, right? this yes absolutely but I mean it's very much also more people also more activities more activities in the sense of yeah we kind of try to make it work what can we, we can get a few things to put stuff together. Oh, and we can get painting supplies. It was literally like that. It's not a top-down, thought-out. It's really more of, okay, can we throw more activities at the thing to make it more interesting, to make it more diverse? We showed them a laptop copyright free movies. We thought about it, we got some but we never set it up. So there's lots of things to fix. Same thing with music. Music. I guess. Maybe longer activities as well because most of these activities can be done in five minutes. Also the weather was mostly not cooperating so there wasn't a lot of chance to do outdoorsy things. This is just, well, oh, well. But a house next time with a bigger garden that we can actually do things outside. A treadmill to exercise so that people can be sane. Sanity is overrated. The reason why we're here is because this was the only house we could afford. Yeah. I could have got you a castle but you would have all had to pay for your own flights and everything else. It's different, right? We would have spent over 10,000 euros on this. Despite all the things that you mentioned, I think you did incredibly well so far. So far so good, right? I mean, nothing is on fire. Nobody in our community has tried to do this before. There might have been a reason. I remember seeing this in the biggest computing ten years ago, when they put some cameras up in the house and people did some ADLs for a weekend. This is far inaccessible. Speaking of food, I think I have to go to... I checked the potatoes earlier. They were still rock solid. So my take of it... This is one aspect. The other aspect was, okay, we have the sensors we could get on short notice, mostly because you happen to have them lying around. This, again, it worked so far so good. We ran into some minor technical issues for various weird reasons. But this is certainly not the best setup to do this sort of thing, right? So I guess what, and this is not necessarily something we absolutely need to collect now, but maybe something to think about, assuming infinite time and infinite budget, what would be the thing we actually wanted to do? Because then we can go down from, okay, what of this is actually feasible to do? So there's a question, what if the price of admission, let's say, had been to buy some kind of equipment? So everything is paid for, except you need to bring your own set of goggles or whatever. Would people run into trouble okay then you have to check how you like them yes they're semi-boiled well it's probably fine no it's probably fine right yes yes yes turn it off turn it off dump it out then they need to cool down everybody trusts everybody in this room and and that's even right fundamentally what we need to have to get this to work right but if it was a 500 euro entrance fee and you got to keep your hardware afterwards i wouldn't have any problem and i think probably it's easier than like uh paying for like the travel because it's it's easier to to to to squeeze in some hardware budget somewhere than... You can convince that it's needed for some other project. Than having like official requests for travel and things like that. If there is a thing out there you can buy. If we need to make ivory it ourselves then it might be much more... It's where we're going to get at the moment. It's just something to keep in mind so that if there is something that we desire... Look at the challenges we had with this. Battery life. We went to numerous different options for batteries. I have 36 GoPro batteries in DCU. We bought double of everything. We even tried AA battery packs wired through a voltage regulator. Maybe to cool them down a bit. We had to go with this approach. Then they were overheating. We even tried fans inside. There was a huge amount of effort to get to what you're wearing right right now it actually works so even if we did this again in 18 months time"

What is actually the eye tracking experiment? I still don't understand. Just a reading experiment. Just covering data for a reading task. There's a demo at ICM Multimedia. What is the research question? For the eye tracking? It's not really a big research question here. We had to use it because we brought the hardware to here. You know what's also cool? I heard from our forensics friends what I kind of like these days is from data to activities so basically which kind of activities could be reconstructed on the sensors like mobile if you have it in a back pocket in a backpack in a front pocket can you reconstruct the activity based on it especially what you can do with the Fitbit right yeah but most people in criminal cases don't wear don't wear Fitbits. Most people have a mobile, like in a backpack. This kind of activity can directly not provide everybody with a cheap Android phone and running sensors.

"The image shows a kitchen scene. In the foreground, there is a doorway with a wooden door. Inside the kitchen, there are white tiled floors, white cabinets, a black countertop, and two bar stools with a towel draped over one of them. There is also a trash can and some other items on the counter. Given the presence of kitchen elements and bar stools, it's likely that the activity taking place is related to eating or preparing food. However, without more information or clearer context within the image, it is difficult to definitively classify the specific activity.",203,206," you you you you you you you Nå er vi på Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske Norske N I'm going to put the ham in the oven.

Da verstehe ich noch, dass es Inlandflüge gibt. Aber gut, Zürich, Genf ist gerade noch die längste Strecke, wo man noch irgendwie theoretisch was findet. Es ist so unsinnig, weil es ist ja nicht nur so, dass es eine direkte Zugverbindung gäbe von Zürich Hauptbahnhof nach Genf Bahnhof. Nee, der Zug fährt ja von Flughafen zu Flughafen. Ja, Genf fährt auch den Flughafen durch. Genau, und der Zug, der von Zürich nach Genf fährt, fährt immer zum Flughafen in Zürich. Also es ist, warum gibt es die Flugverbindung? Aber anscheinend ist genug Bedarf da. Früher sind die auch mal nach Zürich, Basel geflogen. Es ist eine Stunde mit dem Zug. Ja, links Wien gab es früher, aber seit die Hochgeschwindigkeitsstrecke ist, gibt es das nicht mehr. Gut, in Basel haben sie ja immer noch nicht geschafft den Flughafen an die Bahn anzubinden. Langsam tut sich jetzt da was. Es könnte sein, dass vielleicht irgendwie bis 2030 steht das dann vielleicht. Die sind ras noch viel besser. Die neue Hochgeschwindigkeitsstrecke nach Klagenfurt ist unter der Landesstraße, die vor dem Flughafen vorbei läuft. Der Tunnel ist breit genug schon, weil man dort mal eine Haltestelle bauen könnte. Aber es gibt eine Teilorganisation der Bahn, die für Hochgeschwindigkeitsstrecken zuständig ist. Die sagt, das betrifft uns ja nicht. Das Landshort Nappen betrifft uns auch nicht. Das ist ja eine Hochgeschwindigkeitsstrecke. Sie haben die Finanzierung nicht einnehmen können. Das heißt, wenn die Strecke im Dezember 25 in Betrieb geht, wird sie zwar unter dem Flughafen durchfahren, aber nicht... Aber nicht... ok. Gut, das... ja. Ich habe noch eine Frage. Ist da zufällig ein Desinfektionsspray? Ein Spray nicht, also so ein Handgel habe ich auch. So ein Handgel? Nein, du hast natürlich irgendwas gebraucht. Ich habe da blöd, so ein Nagelbett. Du kannst schon so ein Desinfektionsgel drauf, das würde ein bisschen bringen, aber es ist..."

There are data sets, few data sets here and there, so just to give an example, so for example when you normally start reviewing, maybe we didn't think that way, but I talked to Cajal several times about it, you say for example, aha I'm looking for a video, Cajal says for example, let's go first LSE and I'll give you VBS, you know, the same example, it's almost a conversation.

There are data sets, few data sets here and there, so just to give an example, so for example when you normally start reviewing, maybe we didn't think that way, but I talked to Cajal several times about it, you say for example, aha I'm looking for a video, Cajal says for example, let's go first LSE and I'll give you VBS, you know, the same example, it's almost a conversation. So Kahal says, aha, our anonymous life logger was sitting in a chair, it was a home of a family member and I was looking at something on the wall.

And then you say, oh, it was a painting and there was something white and red on it. So it's kind of giving you extra. So there is like a standard. And then comes the figures. It could be aliens.

He should. Oh, yeah, totally. But how is this a conversation? He should. But how is this a conversation if there's only one party to the conversation and the output is fixed? So how I see it, but maybe it's wrong, we've been developing this kind of for very long. Meaning when you started in 2006-2007 you would be doing Rockio and so on we couldn't do better you know what I mean but that was already this primitive conversation with a system you know like system gives you something you label something as positive and negative you know like and then you go back and so on so you're conversing in a system in a very primitive way. But the queries are fixed. They're just revealed over time. A conversation would be, I give you some high-level information and then you can ask for more information. Who's asked before? We have more SD cards. Yeah. Yes, we have more SD cards. Okay, you're a smart person. So does that mean we don't reply to data? Sometimes. I endeavor to. I think that's a different challenge.

What you could do is, like, rather than prepare these list of hints, prepare, like, one-page description of the scene you're looking for with a lot of detail and then you could have this as an Oracle that people ask again this is so complicated to do it's complicated to do yeah because we would run service somewhere and I really kind of think because you know why we shouldn't overthink it it's's an eCIR challenge. It's eCIR. Or CIGIR challenge. And the other thing is of course who, I mean if you do that based on an LLM you couldn't ensure that the answers are exactly reproducible if different people use CIGIR.

But actually, here is like really user that has information need but is either unwilling or unable to clearly formulate it as a very concise and detailed query so the system then retrieves something and these clarified information that came later on are there because nobody found relevant results so i think this is really good simulation of that information need and conversing. Oh it's not that when you provide additional information, just to help you it's still not that. I mean this.

The group is gathered around a table, likely enjoying food and conversation, which falls under leisure.",3373,3473," beforehand and then they need to stand there, okay, time and show, I describe, and teams can more or less shout into, yeah, but what was this, what was that, right? Essentially have an ad hoc conversation for a VBS-style setting. this could work. For something like this, we could also do it here. I'm a bit more hesitant. Yes, I'm a bit more hesitant for this, because if you do it for VBS with something like V3C, the possible universe of things is so much larger that it's probably questions that are much more easy to answer quickly. Whereas if somebody goes, yeah, but how exactly was this? And then the person takes a while to answer this. I like that, but rather than a retrieval challenge we're still focused on retrieval challenges because I don't know how much I should say because we didn't finish we just started working with Hongi I can say about it Hongi Wang Hongi my PhD with what we started doing why I see it's actually conversation, can I? Yes, four years. But it's kind of in development stage, you know, like so I'm not sure that it works, so I don't like, but so basically this is the general idea. When you formulate information need, and I think that's what you did well with VBS and LSE, When you kind of get an information need you often not able to formulate it clearly, or unwilling, or so you want to use as short query as possible and get the relevant result. So we are now developing some agents on both sides, on retrieval and for information need and so on, to handle those sites. But actually, here is like really user that has information need but is either unwilling or unable to clearly formulate it as a very concise and detailed query so the system then retrieves something and these clarified information that came later on are there because nobody found relevant results so i think this is really good simulation of that information need and conversing. Oh it's not that when you provide additional information, just to help you it's still not that. I mean this. So at least I see it already as conversation because you are revealing increasingly more and more specific information need. But when you say that, oh, it's not that, you're seeing something, the system return back to you, so it's kind of two-way already, now we have a lot of teams, how do we handle that? If it's only one team... We are already doing it, because when... Yeah, but that's, I think, why we argue it's probably not conversational because it's one way"

No, but this is what Lukas says, if it's interactive and it's the same for all the teams there, we can do it. This was what Luca said. I think what Stefan is saying is in the IR community now, I'm not really in it anymore, so I don't know, but they do simulate the conversational queries by that kind of an approach and we just work with a simulation. I think for eCIR, yes, be it either automatic or interactive. And ECIR probably needs an interactive challenge at a workshop because it doesn't do that.

Yeah, okay, but then the conclusion would be if we want to do that then we should go with non-item search queries rather than ad hoc queries. We could have ad hoc as well. Well the question is how many query types because I would for sure do Q&A because I think that's the most exciting thing to do on that type of data. Then non-item search and Q&A. Do we need ad hoc? I think we want ad hoc if you want that kind of the pseudo-conversational... No. No, because ad hoc is... Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm wrong, for instance. Do we care about ad hoc every example of...
