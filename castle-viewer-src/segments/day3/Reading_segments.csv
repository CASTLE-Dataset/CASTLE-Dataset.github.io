"**Leisure Activities**

This segment depicts a group of people gathered in a living room, seemingly engaged in a shared activity. The presence of VR headsets suggests they might be playing a virtual reality game or experiencing some form of interactive entertainment. The overall atmosphere points towards a social and recreational gathering.",3234,3490," Come on, come on, come on."

Yeah. Come on, I need you to play this one. I need you to play this one. There's a Ricardo over there, which is essentially the old school version of this. Oh. Oh. Here you go. Come on, let's do this. Okay. Here you go. Yeah, go over there. All right. In the other room. How do you play it? I don't know. I don't know. It's a house game. I will meet you. Here is better. Because this one can break the glass. And we're playing Mikado here. here is better for me yes okay what's the color so basically it's very simple there is a stack of these sticks yes we throw them like this like when you cook spaghetti they go around and then you have to pull them one by one person by person without moving anything okay you're only allowed to touch the one that you are pulling one at a time okay it's an amazing game so similar to what we were playing how do we call it Yes. Wooden Block Tower game. I think I'm gonna take this for myself. He's a fairly keen server. Bjorn knows that my knees are a bit fucked up business. Yes. I brought it once at a training and he was repeating for an hour, don't play, don't play. Please stop. I think I just didn't wanna stop stop. So I managed to break a bone, managed to break a cartilage, managed to break a meristus. How did we used to do this? Like this? Yes. You know when you get sports injuries when you are young and you think you can recover from everything? This is the one that I will probably never manage to solve. Oh man Let me do something for this guy At least I pulled one on the level Still working on the surface You have any sandpaper? What? You get one for free? One went still. I'm gonna remove it. Please, we're fuzzing. Yes, okay. So then just remove? You know what's... This Mikado is somehow small. Normal Mikado is like a bit bigger. Okay, keep going. There are different colors. Yes, there's a mechanism. Blue spiral, here's the 20. Yeah, yeah. Blue, red, blue. That's 10. Blue, red, blue. That's 10. Red, blue, red, blue, red. This one? Yeah, that's ten. Red blue, red blue, red. That's five points. Red yellow blue, that's three. And then red blue is two. Oh my god, this is like complicated. This is two. There used to be only two types, the expensive one and the cheap ones. Yes. Isn't it you're allowed to take as long as you're not touching another one? Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally. As long as it's not moving another one. Yes. Yeah, he took it. Yeah. Yeah. And who has the highest car will. Yeah, but then... No, wait, what's your... I'll take this back. It's your... No, no, no, no. You took one and it's fine? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, I see. Yes. Little sugar. Nothing. All right. This is two. I forgot this one. I will try to pick up this. One by one. No, no, no, no, man. What are you doing? Yeah, what? Huh? We take one by one. One by one? Okay. We take one by one. You don't take all. Until somebody makes by one until somebody makes an error. Okay, I think that's a better version."

Playing Games,101,1127," I think so. Were you producing the blues? Yes. Good. I liked it. I liked it too. The most basic blues riff ever. And now we have Come As You Are. Why are you talking about that? Come As You Are played by Florian. Yeah, I heard that. have we're gonna have the various artists Every artist will be playing in this festival. So boom. Yes Release do you want me to give you better money always TV? Yes We actually do that guitar tab version as well as the recipes right? People can recreate the music that was played. For certain differences of music. Yes. Well, Come As You Are is actually played on an alphabet tuning. And we haven't gone that far. We've kept the original tuning which was badly done in the first place. And that guitar is not maintained tuned very well. Every time you tune one string, the other is all moving. It's very, yes, at the same time. Or to flip this one up. It should be an automatic tuning machine. Put your guitar with a press button and two seconds later it comes perfectly in tune. Or you could just have a... I don't have it here. Try this one. Yeah, then you have to actually hear it properly. No, I mean, they just want to have a... Move, move, move, move. Anyway, after you threw the schedule out of the window, what do you propose as an alternative schedule for actually having a workshop? We do the workshop after lunch, when everybody's maximally sleepy. No, we could do the workshop now, after lunch. No, but that would keep the people preparing lunch. Yeah, after lunch I think is better because people are in the middle of doing things. There's card games going on, there's music, noise making. Did you do the block games? Yes, multiple times. I'm very happy with the block game. The blocks are really terrible, I like it. The blocks are awful. And the more you play it, the worse they get. Did you get so much this year? This was here. The one we played with Klaus, that was a really good one. Because that's quite interesting. The three of us. Oh, yes. Oh, that one. Oh, my God. That was like, yeah, the original. Let's try. It was impossible. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was. You were cute. I kept Klaus in the game at one stage. They were folding it, you know, like. Yeah, I think you almost did it. No. It's really hard. It. Move. No, it's... Move, move, move. Yeah. Maybe I should have done that. I would have collapsed it earlier. Oh. Oh, you should have... And I'm hoping it's a win, you should all have nothing. And I'm not going to win clearly. Look, I have nothing. Yeah. Oh, tough. I actually don't understand what's going on, but it's okay. You can't understand. We can have our type of biscuit in Ireland. That too, but it's the wrong ones. Biscuits are based on this game, I presume. Yes, there's a biscuit based on this game. Biscuit with stick. It actually does have Kimberly McHallow and coconut creams. Oh! No, but there's a biscuit that is shaped like one of the... So our biscuits are different. We have pink, two pink strips on the side and a pink jam no this is very good so actually i'll buy mcconnell's but i think you helped me now no this is a this is a very traditional second place now italian game i don't think it was japanese they have a lot in the table oh you're hiding your stats oh my god it's quite popular in italy as far as i understand i can't move i can't move no nothing you're cooking are you cooking yeah but i don't know it's too early it's too early it's only 12. Oh, yeah, breakfast. Way too early for lunch. We're having lunch at? Two. Two."
