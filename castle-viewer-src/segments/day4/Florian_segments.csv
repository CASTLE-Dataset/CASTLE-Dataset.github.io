If I may, just like you took March, normally submission for regular people like it's going to be seven or something. But this can be much later. Yeah, totally, but you are talking about March, April as a deadline for Watergate. The call for proposals. So we will, so chronologically... When is the deadline going to be there?

Probably February at least, right? It should be sent out. I mean, we will have to see how quickly we can actually get all of this out. This needs to go out sometime within the first quarter of 25. The earlier the better. But before the end of March. We might be able to announce it and give some insights earlier and then say okay you get some bits and pieces. Wait a pieces. I don't get it. If I may, just like you took March, normally submission for regular people like it's going to be seven or something. But this can be much later. Yeah, totally, but you are talking about March, April as a deadline for Watergate. The call for proposals. So we will, so chronologically... When is the deadline going to be there? There's no paper on Hackathon. No. So chronologically there's things happening in order that first the data set goes out because we also need that for the challenge. Then there's going to be a call for hackathon project proposals that is going to happen sufficiently after this so people actually have a chance to look into this. Afterwards, there's going to be a brief review period of these topic proposals to see is this actually something that we think or whoever thinks is feasible to do within the time and resources that we can make available for this. And then there's gonna be a, every project will have a lead, a proposer, who then commits to actually be there and take part. And then other people can sign up and there's probably to be some limited quantity of slots and we will have to figure out how many slots we can actually facilitate for this but there's going to be at least a few weeks between the call for projects and the call for participation.

And then at some point, we won't have the option of 500 people signing up for this, but there's not going to be 500 people who want to sign up for this. It's probably more of a problem to make it sufficiently broadly known that everybody who might be interested actually knows about this early enough so they could actually take part. It's not something people will look for. Has it turned off? Because Karel said there is no paper, are you sure? We've never done a hack town before, right? But what is the motivation then for people to attend because they love it right but they need some some paper for funding the travels that's that's what i think yeah in many universities especially our asian community you know you've seen even the opposite sometimes people get a paper accepted but they don't even appear at the conference yeah i guess the assumption is that there is already a paper at the conference.

Okay, I drive another half an hour and then I'm really done. You know what he says. I stopped there. Still not the spot. I just called dealership and told them, your car is there, I'm done. Because it was still in this trial period. So that was one attempt. Move the car somewhere else and run a cable out of a bedroom or something. It's fine. I mean, I think it's fine for now. If we continue with the workshop, then we will all be able to leave soon. Yeah, okay. Give us a story time later. Okay, we've decided. It's a... No, no, no. Just a second. Just a second. For workshops, you cannot do the post conference. I did in Chengdu workshop, so they have really tight timeline. And that's also a little bit later than regular papers. it's not really much later it's not really that you can do it after the conference I guess if you do separate proceedings I understand you can't do it because there is one volume of workshop proceedings yes but no there's not every workshop has a separate proceedings that gives us the opportunity for a hackathon cannot be written, the paper cannot be written until after the hackathon. Explain it to the name, I don't want to mention it. Yes, no, but this is fine. This is a very... Klaus, you've agreed to do that to do that. This is a very solvable problem. This is essentially just get, order another set of proceedings with ACM Publishing. Yeah, that's fine. If SIGMEM says, no, look, there's another event that has proceedings a month later, then there's going to be another event that has proceedings a month later. And ACM Publishing, whatever,IGMM something for that. But SIGMM wanted a hackathon, so... Yes. Right. But let's check it, if it's possible. It's possible. Just tell them that this is what needs to happen. And then it will happen somehow. I also never did it, because I know we were breaking spines. Once with Miriam Reddy, I remember in Brisbane Really took out a paper some time and it was pretty much like regular proceedings and also last time I did for Chengdu It was also But they're usually only very very Specific about their their dates because they say okay. No the thing needs to be published at that point in time Therefore you need to'll need to send it in in time. We say, look, this is published whenever. And we'll give them a third set of dates for the Hackathon publication. Oh, I think it's possible. Yeah, with a targeted publication date of end of the year or something. It's just impossible to do it any other way. Unless you're on the Hackathon two months early. That's not happening. Now, my old son're going to have a call for hackathon topics. Yes. That are at least somewhat health related. Some of them. Well yeah what we said before was to say it should be data exploration and or data augmentation based on this data set and then if you want to slant it towards the health thing in addition to that fair enough and this was just going to be the criteria by which this is going to be judged. Because that's what came out of that workshop. Yeah, but we can put that into the call as an example and say... What happens if nobody comes up with a health-based idea? Then we've just done a hackathon as per CIG-MM's request from the very senior people in the field saying, let's do a health-based hackathon.

Now you should send back mail to them and say, now we have made this, now it's your turn to actually assemble a group to work on something right okay so it's a responsibility that's something and i mean even most of these people are very senior they probably have research groups with lots of people so they can just go to the group and say you you five you go to the hackathon and work on this right so the catch is i is, I like that one, and I think it would be, so how the city of Amsterdam did it, and I think those were really nice hackathons, there is not a fate but a clear need. We have these panoramas and we use them to monitor problems in a public space, crowdiness, this and that, state of the assets and all. But you know it kind of helps if there are more users, if more departments commit to making something useful out of it. So basically there is some coordination going on, Chief Technology Office approached them, you know, like people are really interested, genuinely, I have this process and if I can cut two million per year, it's amazing, you know come there and they think look it doesn't have to it can be vague i said it already like uh advertisement uh public advertisement is just wild west you know like so can we get it from panoramas you know like if the panorama is recorded three times per month we can so do something with that you don't have to be yeah but i guess it's the difference difference in terms of the motivation if you work with your own data or data from your own organization or you do something on another data set. So I think here it's more probably we're more targeting the research community with this call than a company saying oh yeah this is a kind of a proxy of the problem we are interested in a bit because then why wouldn't they provide their own data and do a challenge on that so what i wanted to say is then uh they did have clear interest it seemed at ac multimedia kind of to uh come up with a few very signature uh use cases uh test beds and so on and this is one of them basically so we could ask because they had clear ideas about his agents for example Great, they should propose Yes, they have vested interest because that was the part of that Yeah, but there's also research I think you can't compare it with your example of the end users bringing an interest or someone in the research community be interested But anyway, you can propose a topic Yes, so now we did the work, we will facilitate this and then we play the ball back to them and say look if you want concrete topics around this area then you go and make it happen. We gave you the data, we gave you the framework, we gave you the location, we even ordered the catering and you just show up and make it happen. Or your people if you don't show up yourself right I was thinking like how often are those steering type of meetings I'm guessing annually this is the first time this particular no no no but last year oh not happening before. It's not a series meeting. So I was just like thinking, okay, maybe, yeah let's see, but I think people may be interested in kind of chipping in with some ideas. I mean what you can still do if you see that there is few submissions or there is no topics covered, directly approach some people and say you want to propose a topic for you. Stefan, maybe you can propose garbage detection. We worked very hard to make data for you. Yes, yes. I'll plug it in somewhere else. I mean garbage detection. Switch? Yes, yeah. If you're cold? I'm not cold, but if you want to switch, I can. Look at it. No, no, I was just touching it because you were looking like you were cold. No, I'm not cold.

But we are also cooling the homes, so the heating is working harder, so I think we already kind of... Oh, don't worry. The building isn't that well insulated anyway.

We have these panoramas and we use them to monitor problems in a public space, crowdiness, this and that, state of the assets and all. But you know it kind of helps if there are more users, if more departments commit to making something useful out of it. So basically there is some coordination going on, Chief Technology Office approached them, you know, like people are really interested, genuinely, I have this process and if I can cut two million per year, it's amazing, you know come there and they think look it doesn't have to it can be vague i said it already like uh advertisement uh public advertisement is just wild west you know like so can we get it from panoramas you know like if the panorama is recorded three times per month we can so do something with that you don't have to be yeah but i guess it's the difference difference in terms of the motivation if you work with your own data or data from your own organization or you do something on another data set. So I think here it's more probably we're more targeting the research community with this call than a company saying oh yeah this is a kind of a proxy of the problem we are interested in a bit because then why wouldn't they provide their own data and do a challenge on that so what i wanted to say is then uh they did have clear interest it seemed at ac multimedia kind of to uh come up with a few very signature uh use cases uh test beds and so on and this is one of them basically so we could ask because they had clear ideas about his agents for example Great, they should propose Yes, they have vested interest because that was the part of that Yeah, but there's also research I think you can't compare it with your example of the end users bringing an interest or someone in the research community be interested But anyway, you can propose a topic Yes, so now we did the work, we will facilitate this and then we play the ball back to them and say look if you want concrete topics around this area then you go and make it happen. We gave you the data, we gave you the framework, we gave you the location, we even ordered the catering and you just show up and make it happen. Or your people if you don't show up yourself right I was thinking like how often are those steering type of meetings I'm guessing annually this is the first time this particular no no no but last year oh not happening before. It's not a series meeting. So I was just like thinking, okay, maybe, yeah let's see, but I think people may be interested in kind of chipping in with some ideas. I mean what you can still do if you see that there is few submissions or there is no topics covered, directly approach some people and say you want to propose a topic for you. Stefan, maybe you can propose garbage detection. We worked very hard to make data for you. Yes, yes. I'll plug it in somewhere else. I mean garbage detection. Switch? Yes, yeah. If you're cold? I'm not cold, but if you want to switch, I can. Look at it. No, no, I was just touching it because you were looking like you were cold. No, I'm not cold. If somebody gives me their bedroom, you will drag her there. Oh, cough hole. Mine is on the ground floor. Your bathroom would also be plastered just wanna hang the wire at the window. You can put it in my bedroom, no problem. I already have this sustainability. Mine is just in front of the... I'll move the card and everybody's gonna be warm, right? No, no, no, not now. We'll show up first. We are not... No three minute breaks. You're staying here. You know what's bizarre? We are now helping the planet by charging this without electricity. But we are also cooling the homes, so the heating is working harder, so I think we already kind of... Oh, don't worry. The building isn't that well insulated anyway. Okay, so let me summarize this to say, we have decided there's some kind of a process through which a hackathon takes place.

And it keeps getting increasingly difficult to draw any conclusions from this. So either we cut down on this or we lean into it.

Is this now the new site collection that we would code? Yeah. So I personally would even prefer using only v3c and VPS in the future, but for question answering tasks, the medical data set maybe again and removing also the MVK again.

Using Phone,1708,1831," I'm going to go obsolete anyway because there's going to be new questions that require new types of data. Yeah, I fully agree with that. And in addition I think if we have one data set only for VPS it would definitely simplify everything or even the barrier to go into the competition for new teams. It could be just restricting task types, so as you say maybe keeping one for QA and then maybe having visual non-item search still for specific types of data. Or maybe for LSE. For me LSE is a live log search challenge. And it should remain that way. Yes, it should remain a LifeLog search challenge. It's in the name. We have to keep them separate, right? That's what we're doing in this conversation. We're saying, because of BBS, there's an LSE. And that one also has a lower barrier to entry. And there's a POV. Even the video browser. Alhamdulillah, for me, LSE's life looks like a jelly bean. It is, yes. The question is if we were to do a search in videos there. Like these videos. That's the difference between LSE and VBS. No, because semantically... Like this is the POV challenge. No, because I guess... And I don't want to go too much into the philosophical discussion of what a life log is, But so far, the life log, the notion of what a life log is, has been dictated by what type of data was possible to collect and what type of data was possible to be made available for this sort of thing, given the technology that existed at the time of the recordings of this life log. Because this is also a type of log, it's just something that you... It's a merging of the two, somehow. But his stream would be his live log, my stream is my live log. Yes, exactly. I don't think stationary cameras... No, stationary cameras... It could be a... There could be such a thing as a multi-perspective live log if you say, look, person one has a lot of stationary cameras in their house and spends a lot of time in their house, and person two spends a lot of time abroad or all over the place and is having a wearable camera, and person three does not have a camera at all but essentially narrates their audio log and takes a bunch of pictures. All of these things could be different forms of Live Logs. Yeah, this is right. Community Live Log works. Yes. Group Live Log. It's still different to what the LSC up until now has done. Yes. It's been a single person. But is it because this is precisely the challenge that is the best challenge there could be?

Or do we say, no, we want explicitly image sequence then, because for some reason, this particular thing is the most interesting. But the LSC challenge, we still do have more multimodal data than anybody actually uses. So it's still there. You can still use the heart rates and all those things if you want to use it. I mean so far there have been very few questions, very few tasks where it would actually be useful. So it's a bit of a chicken and egg. Nobody's processing it.

Setting Table,1831,1832," I'm going to go obsolete anyway because there's going to be new questions that require new types of data. Yeah, I fully agree with that.

It could be just restricting task types, so as you say maybe keeping one for QA and then maybe having visual non-item search still for specific types of data. Or maybe for LSE.

And I don't want to go too much into the philosophical discussion of what a life log is, But so far, the life log, the notion of what a life log is, has been dictated by what type of data was possible to collect and what type of data was possible to be made available for this sort of thing, given the technology that existed at the time of the recordings of this life log.

But the LSC challenge, we still do have more multimodal data than anybody actually uses. So it's still there. You can still use the heart rates and all those things if you want to use it. I mean so far there have been very few questions, very few tasks where it would actually be useful. So it's a bit of a chicken and egg. Nobody's processing it.

Discussing,1854,1855," I'm going to go obsolete anyway because there's going to be new questions that require new types of data. Yeah, I fully agree with that.

And I don't want to go too much into the philosophical discussion of what a life log is, But so far, the life log, the notion of what a life log is, has been dictated by what type of data was possible to collect and what type of data was possible to be made available for this sort of thing, given the technology that existed at the time of the recordings of this life log.

But the LSC challenge, we still do have more multimodal data than anybody actually uses. So it's still there. You can still use the heart rates and all those things if you want to use it. I mean so far there have been very few questions, very few tasks where it would actually be useful. So it's a bit of a chicken and egg. Nobody's processing it. Yeah so I would recommend for LSE that you only keep the image-based data dataset because the entry barrier is much lower for new teams."
Using Phone,1942,2041," I'm going to go obsolete anyway because there's going to be new questions that require new types of data. Yeah, I fully agree with that. And in addition I think if we have one data set only for VPS it would definitely simplify everything or even the barrier to go into the competition for new teams. It could be just restricting task types, so as you say maybe keeping one for QA and then maybe having visual non-item search still for specific types of data. Or maybe for LSE. For me LSE is a live log search challenge. And it should remain that way. Yes, it should remain a LifeLog search challenge. It's in the name. We have to keep them separate, right? That's what we're doing in this conversation. We're saying, because of BBS, there's an LSE. And that one also has a lower barrier to entry. And there's a POV. Even the video browser. Alhamdulillah, for me, LSE's life looks like a jelly bean. It is, yes. The question is if we were to do a search in videos there. Like these videos. That's the difference between LSE and VBS. No, because semantically... Like this is the POV challenge. No, because I guess... And I don't want to go too much into the philosophical discussion of what a life log is, But so far, the life log, the notion of what a life log is, has been dictated by what type of data was possible to collect and what type of data was possible to be made available for this sort of thing, given the technology that existed at the time of the recordings of this life log. Because this is also a type of log, it's just something that you... It's a merging of the two, somehow. But his stream would be his live log, my stream is my live log. Yes, exactly. I don't think stationary cameras... No, stationary cameras... It could be a... There could be such a thing as a multi-perspective live log if you say, look, person one has a lot of stationary cameras in their house and spends a lot of time in their house, and person two spends a lot of time abroad or all over the place and is having a wearable camera, and person three does not have a camera at all but essentially narrates their audio log and takes a bunch of pictures. All of these things could be different forms of Live Logs. Yeah, this is right. Community Live Log works. Yes. Group Live Log. It's still different to what the LSC up until now has done. Yes. It's been a single person. But is it because this is precisely the challenge that is the best challenge there could be? Or is it because this is the task that could be reasonably made available and therefore the best feasible task that could actually be implemented? as in if there was instrumentation to record many, many more things, would we want that? Or do we say, no, we want explicitly image sequence then, because for some reason, this particular thing is the most interesting.

So we should also probably consider that now, and that you have an IR, maybe that's like for them, people are increasingly kind of playing with LLM taking that role. So instead of having these volunteers you could actually take a very large model, show it the content alongside the ground truth and actually make it act as some sort of oracle. Well you don't need the content alongside the ground truth. I mean if you describe the ground truth, I think that there's two things here. One thing is you show it the content, but then you rely on the capabilities of that model doing the visual interpretation, which is a bit dangerous, I think.

"Based on the image, the most appropriate classification for this segment is **Setting Table**.

Here's why:

*   **The table is laid out with placemats, plates, cups, and cutlery.** This indicates preparation for a meal.
*   **The person in the image appears to be interacting with items on the table, possibly placing or arranging them.**

While other activities might occur in a dining setting, the visual evidence strongly points to the act of setting the table for a meal.",2746,2749," and say, okay, there's volunteers that are being shown the clips and then we can see do they have access to the clip or they're shown the clip beforehand and then we actually have to remember and then they're just there and say okay I'm gonna describe this to you and you can shout questions at me and then maybe we need to have a not everybody shouting at once kind of mechanism but this would essentially be a new variant of kiss yeah which is less predictable but is is inherently more interactive because it is actually back and forth between an intelligent agent, as in a person describing what they remember, and all the people searching for it.

So just translating it without going into that one, it's not related to this story when you get those results basically you would like to know how far is it from the ground truth so this mental image of what you just described that's like information if Oracle meaning you and the system knows that Oracle beforehand because they probably answered it. So now there are these tools and they're getting increasingly good, you know, like, in different kind of asking, hey, what is there and not in this set or from this set, which one is what. So maybe people could, it just doesn't help, they don't have to use it. asking question questions, they select some examples and submit them there to you. And somewhere mid or few times during that process they get automatic feedback. So whenever it is wrong, they get information about what is different. Yes, this is a very interesting approach. But you could do that also with a human there. You don't have to automate it. It's very heavy, you know, like meaning... Now you would have to limit it. Especially if you have 16 teams. You don't want someone to select their best 1000 images and tell them what's different, right? Yeah, I don't know. I guess you can guide it and say you can send one image per minute or so. No, you could even do this and say no, the submission process and the scoring process is exactly the same. But rather than just getting the feedback, your submission was correct, your submission was not correct, every time it was not correct, you're also getting more information back. Because this is also more what would happen if you were to talk to the archivist and say, is it this this and they said no it's it's similar but it's not"

I don't know what it was, but 140, 190. Yeah, that's the best case. But that's probably later because the flight will depart in about 2 hours. 140 you can somehow...

I thought this was... When you get out of Galway, this is a lake, right? This is not the sea. It's a lake that every once in a while they have to go down to the tree park. Yeah, but there's not too many trees around here. It should be fine. It's too dark here. Shall we just pass and find out? Yeah, yeah, yeah. On the highway this was really looking good. Because we went from high to... We have planned to leave at 5 am. For when is this? this? Right now it's 2 a.m. Okay, okay. But at least that means that after 2 a.m. it should be better.

Yeah, in Amsterdam. Yeah, yeah, yesterday Anna told me that Amsterdam was already yesterday. Meaning there she's seen also when we were moving buildings, when we were moving to new apartment, it was so strong storm, it almost flipped these Mercedes trucks that we were using, that I really like. I don't know what it was, but 140, 190. Yeah, that's the best case. But that's probably later because the flight will depart in about 2 hours. 140 you can somehow... So by that time we should already be in Dublin. Very strong, yeah. But, very strong. But if it's delayed by a much longer hours, we can, you know. 140 hours. Yeah, but we won't report. Because the flight will depart in a little while. Time Ireland, nine, that, and then we'll leave in Frankfurt.

Yeah, but there's not too many trees around here. It should be fine. It's too dark here. Shall we just pass and find out? Yeah, yeah, yeah. On the highway this was really looking good. Because we went from high to... We have planned to leave at 5 am. For when is this? this? Right now it's 2 a.m. Okay, okay. But at least that means that after 2 a.m. it should be better.

"Based on the image, the most appropriate classification is **Making Coffee**.

Here's why:

*   **Visible Coffee Maker:** The image clearly shows a coffee maker on the counter.
*   **Kitchen Environment:** The setting appears to be a kitchen, which is where coffee is typically made.
*   **Other Coffee-Related Items:** While not explicitly clear, there are other items on the counter that could be associated with coffee preparation (e.g., mugs, coffee grounds, etc.).

While other categories might be loosely related to the broader scene, the direct visual evidence points most strongly to the act of making coffee.",1495,1502," flippers that would have been a funny joke probably.
