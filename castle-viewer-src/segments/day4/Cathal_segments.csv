"The images show a person adjusting a head-mounted device in front of a mirror. This action is not directly related to any of the provided categories. However, if we consider the context of the head-mounted device, it's possible the person is preparing for or engaged in an activity that isn't explicitly listed. Without more information about the device or the person's intent, it's difficult to make a definitive classification.

If the head-mounted device is a camera or recording equipment, the person might be preparing for a ""Leisure Activity"" such as vlogging or filming. If it's a VR headset, it could be related to ""Playing Games"" or another form of ""Leisure Activity.""

Afterwards there's going to be a brief review period of these topic proposals to see is this actually something that we think or whoever thinks is feasible to do within the time and resources that we can make available for this and then there's going to be a every project will have a lead a proposer who then commits to actually be there and take part and then other people can sign up and there's probably going to be some limited quantity of slots and we will have to figure out how many slots we can actually facilitate for this but there's going to be at least a few weeks between the call for projects and the call for participation. Even the registration, I mean even the signing up for the for the hackathon is just part of the conference registration. So this can be even later. And then at some point, we won't have the option of 500 people signing up for this. But there's not going to be 500 people who want to sign up for this. It's probably more of a problem to make it sufficiently broadly known that everybody"

Washing dishes,115,197," It's a post-conference... Just a minute, just a minute. For workshops, you cannot do the post-conference. I did a workshop in Chengdu, so they have a really tight timeline. And that's also a little bit later than regular papers. It not really much later it's not really that you can do it after the conference but i guess if you do separate proceedings it's a separate proceedings right i understand you can't do it because there is one volume of work but the work yes but no there's not every workshop has individual proceedings so that gives us the opportunity for a hackathon cannot be written. The paper cannot be written until after the hackathon. Explain it to the name I don't want to mention. You know the... Who's going to talk? This is fine. This is a very... I just didn't want to say the name. Klaus, you've agreed to do that? But this is a very solid problem. This is essentially just get... Order another set of proceedings with ACM Publishing. Yeah, that's fine. If SIGM says, no, look, there's another event that has proceedings a month later, then there's going to be another event that has proceedings a month later. And ACM Publishing, whatever, will charge cgm something for that but they gave him one to the hackathon so yes right but let's check it if it's possible it's possible just tell them that this is what needs to happen no then it will happen somehow i've also never did because i know we were breaking spine once with miriam ready i remember in uh br really to get a paper sometime and it was pretty much like regular proceedings and also last time I did it for Chengdu it was also Yes, but they're usually very, very specific about their dates because they say, okay, no, the thing needs to be published at that point in time therefore you need to send it it in in time. We'll probably end up giving them the dates, and we'll give them a third set of dates for the Hackathon publication, and they'll stick to that. I believe it's possible. With a targeted publication date of end of the year or something. It's just impossible to do it any other way, unless you run the Hackathon two months early, and that doesn't make any no no we're gonna have a cut my understanding is gonna have a call for hackathon topics yes that are at least some of what health related some of them well what we said before was to say it should be data exploration and or data augmentation based on this data set. And then if you want to slant it towards the health thing, in addition to that, fair enough. And this was just going to be the criteria by which this is going to be judged. Because that's what came out of that workshop, health-based hackathon. What happens if nobody comes up with a health-based idea? Then we've just done the hackathon as per SIG MM's request from the very senior people in the field, so let's do a health-based hackathon. Oh look, we're doing one on tracking of expressions on faces. No. Yes. No. You cannot control what people want to learn. If people are interested in doing other things with a data set, let people also do other things with a data set. But then should we not have ourselves a health hackathon? The thing is, how many people have been at this senior? I've not been invited. I wouldn't know, right? About 20. Yeah, so one of these 20 people are then supposed to propose a topic. Yeah, exactly. So now... I understand that they're all busy, but one of them... Well, basically what... Now you should send back mail to them and say, now we have made this, now it's your turn to actually assemble a group to work on something, right? Okay. So it's a responsibility. And I mean even most of these people are very senior, they probably have research groups with lots of people, so they can just go to the group and say, you five, you go to the hackathon and work on this. So the catch is, I like that one, and I think it would be, so how the city of Amsterdam did it, and I think those were really nice hackathons, there is not a fake but a clear need. We have these panoramas and we use them to monitor problems in a public space, crowdiness, this and that, state of the assets and all that. But you know, it kind of helps if there are more users, if more departments commit to making something useful out of it. So basically, there is some coordination going on, Chief Technology Office approached them and all that kind of, people are really interested, genuinely, I have this process and if I can cut two million per year, it's amazing, you know. So they come there and they think look Doesn't have to it can be vague guys said it already like Advertisement public advertisement is just wild west, you know, like so can we get it from panoramas? You know, if the panorama is recorded a few times per month we can So do something with that Yeah I guess there's a difference in terms of the motivation if you work with your own data, data from your own organization and you do something on another data set. So I think here it's more probably we're more targeting the research community with this goal than a company saying oh yeah this is a kind of a proxy of the problem we are interested in because then why wouldn't they provide their own data and do a challenge on that? So what I wanted to say is that they did have clear interest it seemed at AC Multimedia kind of to come up with a few very signature use cases, testbeds and so on and this is one of them basically so we could ask because they had clear ideas about his agents for example yeah that's what i said yeah they have vested interest because that was the part of that yeah but there's also research i think you can't compare it with your example of the end users bringing an interest or someone in the research community interested but anyway yes so so now we we did the work we will facilitate this and then we We play the ball back to them and say look if you want concrete topics around this area then you go and make it happen. We gave you the data, we gave you the framework, we gave you the location, we even ordered the catering and you just show up and make it happen. Or send your if you don't show up yourself i was more thinking like how often are those steering type of meetings i'm guessing annually because this is the first time this particular meeting has happened no no but last year oh yeah that was not happening before it's not a steering committee meeting So I was No, no, no, but last year, oh yeah, that was not happening before. It's not a steering committee meeting. Uh-huh, so I was just like thinking, okay, maybe. Yeah, let's see, but I think people may be interested in a kind of chipping in with some ideas. Okay, so. Yeah, let's see how we. What happens, so. I mean, what you can still do if you see that there is few submissions or there is no topics covered, directly approach some people and say if you want to propose a topic for them. Stefan, maybe you can propose garbage detection or something. Yeah. We've got a proposal. I'll leave it for you. I'll plug it in somewhere else."

So basically, there is some coordination going on, Chief Technology Office approached them and all that kind of, people are really interested, genuinely, I have this process and if I can cut two million per year, it's amazing, you know. So they come there and they think look Doesn't have to it can be vague guys said it already like Advertisement public advertisement is just wild west, you know, like so can we get it from panoramas? You know, if the panorama is recorded a few times per month we can So do something with that Yeah I guess there's a difference in terms of the motivation if you work with your own data, data from your own organization and you do something on another data set. So I think here it's more probably we're more targeting the research community with this goal than a company saying oh yeah this is a kind of a proxy of the problem we are interested in because then why wouldn't they provide their own data and do a challenge on that? So what I wanted to say is that they did have clear interest it seemed at AC Multimedia kind of to come up with a few very signature use cases, testbeds and so on and this is one of them basically so we could ask because they had clear ideas about his agents for example yeah that's what i said yeah they have vested interest because that was the part of that yeah but there's also research i think you can't compare it with your example of the end users bringing an interest or someone in the research community interested but anyway yes so so now we we did the work we will facilitate this and then we We play the ball back to them and say look if you want concrete topics around this area then you go and make it happen. We gave you the data, we gave you the framework, we gave you the location, we even ordered the catering and you just show up and make it happen. Or send your if you don't show up yourself i was more thinking like how often are those steering type of meetings i'm guessing annually because this is the first time this particular meeting has happened no no but last year oh yeah that was not happening before it's not a steering committee meeting So I was No, no, no, but last year, oh yeah, that was not happening before. It's not a steering committee meeting. Uh-huh, so I was just like thinking, okay, maybe. Yeah, let's see, but I think people may be interested in a kind of chipping in with some ideas. Okay, so. Yeah, let's see how we. What happens, so. I mean, what you can still do if you see that there is few submissions or there is no topics covered, directly approach some people and say if you want to propose a topic for them. Stefan, maybe you can propose garbage detection or something. Yeah. We've got a proposal. I'll leave it for you. I'll plug it in somewhere else."

And that's also a little bit later than regular papers. It not really much later it's not really that you can do it after the conference but i guess if you do separate proceedings it's a separate proceedings right i understand you can't do it because there is one volume of work but the work yes but no there's not every workshop has individual proceedings so that gives us the opportunity for a hackathon cannot be written. The paper cannot be written until after the hackathon. Explain it to the name I don't want to mention. You know the... Who's going to talk? This is fine. This is a very... I just didn't want to say the name. Klaus, you've agreed to do that? But this is a very solid problem. This is essentially just get... Order another set of proceedings with ACM Publishing. Yeah, that's fine. If SIGM says, no, look, there's another event that has proceedings a month later, then there's going to be another event that has proceedings a month later. And ACM Publishing, whatever, will charge cgm something for that but they gave him one to the hackathon so yes right but let's check it if it's possible it's possible just tell them that this is what needs to happen no then it will happen somehow i've also never did because i know we were breaking spine once with miriam ready i remember in uh br really to get a paper sometime and it was pretty much like regular proceedings and also last time I did it for Chengdu it was also Yes, but they're usually very, very specific about their dates because they say, okay, no, the thing needs to be published at that point in time therefore you need to send it it in in time. We'll probably end up giving them the dates, and we'll give them a third set of dates for the Hackathon publication, and they'll stick to that. I believe it's possible. With a targeted publication date of end of the year or something. It's just impossible to do it any other way, unless you run the Hackathon two months early, and that doesn't make any no no we're gonna have a cut my understanding is gonna have a call for hackathon topics yes that are at least some of what health related some of them well what we said before was to say it should be data exploration and or data augmentation based on this data set. And then if you want to slant it towards the health thing, in addition to that, fair enough. And this was just going to be the criteria by which this is going to be judged. Because that's what came out of that workshop, health-based hackathon. What happens if nobody comes up with a health-based idea? Then we've just done the hackathon as per SIG MM's request from the very senior people in the field, so let's do a health-based hackathon. Oh look, we're doing one on tracking of expressions on faces. No. Yes. No. You cannot control what people want to learn. If people are interested in doing other things with a data set, let people also do other things with a data set. But then should we not have ourselves a health hackathon? The thing is, how many people have been at this senior? I've not been invited. I wouldn't know, right? About 20. Yeah, so one of these 20 people are then supposed to propose a topic. Yeah, exactly. So now... I understand that they're all busy, but one of them... Well, basically what... Now you should send back mail to them and say, now we have made this, now it's your turn to actually assemble a group to work on something, right? Okay. So it's a responsibility. And I mean even most of these people are very senior, they probably have research groups with lots of people, so they can just go to the group and say, you five, you go to the hackathon and work on this. So the catch is, I like that one, and I think it would be, so how the city of Amsterdam did it, and I think those were really nice hackathons, there is not a fake but a clear need.

"Based on the image, the most appropriate category is **Washing dishes**.

Here's why:

*   **Visible dirty dishes and cutlery:** The image shows a significant amount of used dishes, plates, and cutlery piled on the counter and in a drying rack.
*   **Drying rack:** The presence of a drying rack specifically for dishes strongly indicates that dishes are being washed or have just been washed.
*   **Sink area:** The scene is set in a kitchen, likely near the sink, which is the primary location for washing dishes.

While other activities might have occurred before or after, the visual evidence most strongly points to the act of washing dishes.",378,382," It's a post-conference... Just a minute, just a minute.

I'll move the card and everybody's going to be warm, no no not now okay so let me summarize this to say we have decided on some kind of a process to which a hackathon takes place. One of those hackathons will be suggested to senior SIG-MM people to be a healthcare one that they figure out based on this dataset. Here's details of the dataset. Other people can propose hackathons as well well topics topics for the hackathon so the hackathon is based on this data set okay there is one hackathon yes it is going to be so this particular hackathon is going to use this particular data set what happens if the second hackathon there's no there's no what happens if what happens if hua in and say, we want to do a hackathon on social media something? Do we go, yes, fine, of course, welcome, let's do it? Will it be seen that we sat around the table? How much money do they give you? Okay. Cost of entry. It has never happened before, so we do not need to plan for this event. So this is the... If it did happen, if they give you enough money, you'll do. So this is interesting, I think we could have two models that are also justifiable. So our community, our own community, SIGIMEM decided to have one hackathon that's based on real heterogeneous multimedia data and health-based topics. If anybody else would like hackathon, well you have to fund it somehow to make the rewards and apply so that we can react to that."

With conference starting on Monday and not being able to gather rooms on Sunday. So I find it quite difficult. I think an alternative version would be to keep the 3C collection as the main collection and work with one or two satellite collections which rotate. Because now there's a question of how much more do we learn now from, for example, the medical collection? We know it's extremely hard. Do we need to, you know, or is this now the new site collection that we would do? Yeah, so I personally would even prefer using only v3c and VPS in the future, but for question answering tasks and removing the medical data set maybe again and removing also the NVK again. But I mean this is a good direction to plan the next generation of challenge data set. Because I mean v3c was primarily designed for track width, so I had quite some discussions with the people behind track width, specifically the ADS track, at track width, to see, okay, what is it they would want and need from this? And then it was mostly, oh, we have this new thing, we might as well use it for VDS as well. Given that a new one is coming up within the foreseeable future anyway, we could do some explicit scoping of the requirements and then see what we would need to design for this, for the foreseeable future of properties we already know. and probably by the time we're through through with it it's going to be obsolete anyway because there's going to be new questions that require new types of data I fully agree with that and in addition I think if we have one data set only for VPS it would definitely simplify everything or even a barrier to go into the competition for new teams."

Because I mean v3c was primarily designed for track width, so I had quite some discussions with the people behind track width, specifically the ADS track, at track width, to see, okay, what is it they would want and need from this? And then it was mostly, oh, we have this new thing, we might as well use it for VDS as well. Given that a new one is coming up within the foreseeable future anyway, we could do some explicit scoping of the requirements and then see what we would need to design for this, for the foreseeable future of properties we already know. and probably by the time we're through through with it it's going to be obsolete anyway because there's going to be new questions that require new types of data I fully agree with that and in addition I think if we have one data set only for VPS it would definitely simplify everything or even a barrier to go into the competition for new teams."

"The image depicts a scene that fits best into the category of **Leisure Activities**.

Here's why:

*   **Christmas Tree:** The presence of a Christmas tree suggests a festive or holiday season, which is often associated with leisure and celebration.
*   **People gathered:** While it's not entirely clear what they are doing, the people appear to be together in a relaxed setting, potentially engaging in activities together.
*   **Living/Dining area:** The environment is a living or dining area, a common space for leisure activities at home.

While there might be some elements that could be interpreted differently (e.g., preparing food if they are setting the table for a meal), the overall context leans more towards general leisure.",2972,2973," Two jokes?

It's some kind of cyberpunk sci-fi sect. I think we need to actually ask Sigmund to buy us this house. Buys. Do you understand how much money, for me that was really revolutionary, goes to this innovation forms in most of the EU countries? No. It's crazy, insane amounts actually. In many countries you have the following scheme. It's meant for innovation, very healthy innovation. This could be renovation, solving practical problems, you know, like new concrete types, building better buildings, more sustainable buildings, reviving industry in Europe and so on and so on. But you know what happened? Actually, the corporations have figured out a very good way to redirect that money from research institutions of any sort to themselves. You know how? To give you an example. To prove for many of these funds that are enormous, that you are busy with innovation, you just need to prove that you use a computer at the institution those are definitions from 80s it's insane how much money is going i've seen grants given to a device that automatically uh uh turns on and off the life basically it's kind of automatic light yes i mean that's a research grant you You understand that? Like in a certain domain, like in a particular industry. Those things exist. It's just like insane how much of the European money that's actually meant for innovation is siphoned. And I'm not talking about this European Commission grant. That's like national sort of innovation funds. Crazy stuff. Crazy stuff. What did they do with automatic lights? Nothing. I've seen once granted to, I don't want to mention funding, but to a device that turns on and off the light during some sort of performance or something. And I'm like, wait, this is like basically... Wait, boss. Boss boss you have so many solutions including commercial philips labs that everybody has in a country you know how can you get the grant you know if you've ever went to a store you've seen a philips lights no and many cheap versions of philips you can do it and not only do, you can do it in 50 million gallons.

Yes it already happened so why would it happen again? Why would it? They would have learned a lesson and changed the electrics. Yes. Don't make something for yourself. I think I'll donate the Christmas Tree. Then again, when we had the walk yesterday and went to some more beachy area, we encountered a pole with some, or actually a series of poles with electrical wires strung on them. there was one that was just leaning over there and rather than the wires being supported by the pole, the pole was very much supported by the wires. Yes, that does happen. So I'm not surprised that if there's a storm there might be some interruptions in the general availability of power carried by such wires. That's cut.
