That would be very good, I think that's what I got pushed back on a few years ago so I can try it again. Maybe also integrate the video data set there for the LSE because it fits perfectly to it right to the VPS it would also fit because it's video type. But that's the interactive side.

Serving Food,1476,1477," I mean it could even, the data set could possibly even be used in both things but for different purposes. Because the type of tasks in VBS and LSE are technically as as in how they are implemented, very similar. Semantically they're still quite different. And I mean to be honest, like if you take, we have a decent share of wedding videos in the dataset, I mean like a group of people being at a wedding is not so different of us being here. But we've never done anything with it explicitly, right? So we don't have the wedding subtask. This is something we could possibly do for whatever comes after V3C. If there are some directions and say, well, we will inevitably run out of v3c, probably within two years or so. So then we might anyway need to design something else that has new properties for interesting challenges that we foresee for the future. Do you see VBS being able to have a track for a disk data set where somebody can take part but not take part in the VLC data set? That definitely can fit to VBS because we have so many different types already. How would you split the track? I don't know. Do a separate session? That's anyway something that is increasingly a problem with BDS we have seen this this year that we had so many different things going on so many different combinations of data sets and tasks that for every company so for every single combination there were only very few instances so the amount of of data that we actually have, the amount of results, keeps getting smaller and smaller and it keeps getting increasingly difficult to draw any conclusions from this. So either we cut down on this or we lean into it. down would mean we go, we keep the time frame of saying, look, this is a most, well, half day actual challenge, so full day event, but there's still some time to everybody getting settled. And then we only have the six hours or so to actually do evaluations, and there's only so many tasks, so we to just go this down or we say no there's going to be tracks people can sign up for for tracks and then this might be a two-day thing um that runs even possibly in parallel to some of the more of the main conference because it just needs more time and then we say explicitly okay this type of thing is on first day in the morning this type of thing is the first day in the afternoon and then people can decide do they want to do all of it do they want to do some of it but then it becomes more. To be honest even having longer expert sessions in the past years has always been logistic trouble. Yeah. With conference starting on Monday not being able to gather rooms on Sunday. So I find it quite difficult. I think an alternative version would be to kind of keep the 3C collection as the main collection and then work with one or two satellite collections which could rotate, right Because now there's the question of how much more do we learn now from, for example, the medical collection we know is extremely hard. Do we need to, you know, or is this now the new site collection that we would go with? So I personally would even prefer using only V3C at VPS in the future but for question answering tasks and removing the medical data set maybe again and removing also the mvk again but yeah i mean this is this is a good good direction to plan the next generation of of challenge data set right um because i mean v3c was primarily designed for track width. So I had quite some discussions with the people behind track width, specifically the ADS track at track width to see, okay, what is it they would want and need from this? And then it was mostly, oh, we have this new thing, we might as well use it for for VBS as well given that a new one is coming up within the foreseeable future anyway we could do some explicit scoping of the requirements and then see what we would need to design for for this for the foreseeable future of properties we already know and property"

Or maybe for LSE. For me LSE is a life log search challenge challenge. It should remain a lifeblood search challenge. It's in the name. We have to keep them separate, right? And what we're doing in this conversation is saying it's BBS, there's an LSE. And that one also has a lower barrier to entry, even than the video browser. For me, LSC's life looks so challenging. Yes, it is. Actually, if we were to sort the videos there. Like these videos. That blur is the difference between LSC and VBA. This is not a life look. No, because semantically...

And we're trying to simulate this process where you need to inject this memory somehow. And I mean we're trying to do some experiments how well this memory injection thing actually represents what we're doing. But we haven't seen a lot of variation on how this is done. So I would actually really propose to say, OK, why don't we have this more conversational style, for example, and say, OK, there's volunteers that are being shown the clips. And then we can see, do they have access to the clip, or are they showing the clip beforehand, and then they actually have to remember. And then they're just there and say, OK, I'm going to describe this to you, and you can shout questions at me. And then maybe we need to have a not everybody shouting at once kind of mechanism but this would essentially be a new variant of KISS which is less predictable but is inherently more interactive because it is actually back and forth between an intelligent agent, as in a person describing what they remember, and all the people searching for it. So we should also probably consider that now, and that you have an IR, maybe that's like for them, people are increasingly kind of playing with LLM taking that role. So instead of having these volunteers you could actually take a very large model, show it the content alongside the ground truth and actually make it act as some sort of oracle. Well you don't need the content alongside the ground, I mean if you describe ground truth, I think that there's two things here. One thing is you show it the content, but then you rely on the capabilities of that model doing the visual interpretation, which is a bit dangerous, I think. What I could imagine is you try to write it down, and then you purely rely on the text of looking up things in that particular text, for which I think the LLM would be much more reliable. I'm not saying there is one way to do that. Because people are going what can they do actually.

Yeah but the difficult thing is then you're giving information to one team and you don't give the same information to everyone. Because they submitted certain things. So these are two independent things. Both of them are interesting. I would kind of want to try both. One of them is much more easy to implement than the other, because this is a different thing that actually needs to be built, whereas the other is really just, it needs a volunteer and they need to be shown some clips. But this is a very interesting idea. You know what's the problem with volunteer? I can tell you that. So I didn't have it with technology students, never ever, but now in some tracks I have social sciences students.

"The image shows two people in what appears to be a dining room.

There is a dining table set with placemats, glasses, and cups. There are also curtains on the window and a chandelier hanging from the ceiling.

Based on the image, the most appropriate classification for this segment is **Talking**. While they are in a setting that suggests a meal or gathering, the focus of the image seems to be on the interaction between the two individuals, who are both looking towards the viewer. The headlamps suggest they might be involved in some activity that requires light, but without more context, it's difficult to say definitively.

"The most fitting category for this segment is **Washing dishes**.

Here's why:

*   **Visible Dishes and Utensils:** The images prominently feature a large number of dirty dishes, plates, and cutlery piled on the table and in a dish rack.
*   **Dish Rack:** The presence of a dish rack strongly suggests an ongoing or recently completed dishwashing activity.
*   **Context of a Kitchen:** The overall setting is a kitchen, a common place for washing dishes.

While other activities might be implied or have occurred previously, the visual evidence most strongly points to dishwashing as the primary activity depicted in these segments.",2272,2275," Oh, oh no!

"Based on the image, the most appropriate classification for this segment is **Leisure Activities**.

Here's why:

* **The presence of a fireplace:** This suggests a cozy indoor environment often associated with relaxation and leisure.
* **The overall setting:** The room appears to be a living area or a communal space in a home, which are typical locations for leisure activities.
* **The people's postures and implied actions:** While it's not definitively clear what they are doing, their relaxed stances and the general atmosphere point towards activities enjoyed for pleasure rather than work or chores. One person is leaning on chairs, and the other is bending down, possibly interacting with something on the floor, which could be part of a game or hobby.

While other categories might be tangentially related (e.g., if they are playing a game), the overall impression strongly favors leisure.",508,509,"......... Oh نعم I Það Já það er svona svona svona.

"The most fitting category for this segment is **Cleaning**.

Here's why:

* **Visual cues:** The image clearly shows a hand holding an orange cleaning cloth and wiping down a black countertop. There are also water marks or streaks on the counter, suggesting it's being cleaned.
* **Context:** The presence of a blender and what appears to be a dish drying rack further supports the idea that this is a kitchen setting where cleaning tasks would be common.

While there are other objects in the scene, the primary action depicted is cleaning the countertop.",1464,1465," Lấy bịch rác rồi mấy cái chai nước gì đó dọn qua Chai nước thì để lại cũng được On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me a partridge in a pear tree.

Here's why:

*   **Cleanliness:** The overall appearance of the kitchen, with clean countertops and appliances, implies regular upkeep, which would include dishwashing.
*   **Kitchen Essentials:** The arrangement of items like soap, sponges, and drying racks are all indicative of the dishwashing process.

"The image shows a group of people gathered in what appears to be a living room or common area. Some are standing, and one person is seated on a couch. There's a general atmosphere of social interaction, suggesting a leisure activity or a casual gathering. Without more specific context about their actions, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact activity. However, ""Leisure Activities"" is a broad enough category to encompass this scenario.

Who has the computational resources to do these kind simulations? It's not that computationally expensive if you pre-render it. I mean it is, but it's... Is it an easy simulation? Pre-map all the trajectories and then just set it going then I mean with State of the art I mean the Goshen's flat stuff is already There's probably a lot of optimization that could be done for for for these stuff I have no idea what the state of the art is there Just as there's now.

He's quite a blooper reel. I want to take out one thing I said as well. Just one. Just one! That's surprisingly low. Don't repeat it. It would be two. I also just one. Oh, yours is worse. Yours is worse. I don't know if I had any. You should look at the video. You should watch the whole video. A lot of embarrassing. But no, embarrassing is okay, but offensive isn't, right? Yeah. I think the most embarrassing one was... The honey man came in and I just honey man came in and he just went There's a stranger in the house No but I think the camera didn't feel that way Yeah What the fuck is happening? How did he come in? Who let him't mean somebody did not understand the assignment clearly let nobody in no yeah but i've i totally forgot that two minutes yeah yes oh the camera is this way that way take more pictures we'll take more pictures no no no take pictures take pictures"

The quicker you forget you're wearing the cameras. Yeah, exactly. And then you start to... You don't really care about them. That's what we were banking on. Yeah. You're not supposed to constantly censor everything you're saying oh am i gonna look stupid on camera i i know that i'm gonna look stupid on camera i want to go over that particular incident that you were laughing at and see what that looks like from your viewpoint bananas you were like red as a tomato i can i can tell why i was laughing because we had so much dinner already and then you went for the dessert and even got another banana I was very hungry for banana"
