"The most fitting category for this segment is **Meeting**.

Here's why:

*   **Group of people around a table:** This is a common setup for meetings.
*   **Laptop with text on screen:** The laptop suggests a presentation or shared document, typical of a meeting.
*   **People are seated and engaged:** The individuals are positioned as if participating in a discussion or presentation.
*   **The overall atmosphere appears to be focused:** While there might be some casual elements like food and drink, the presence of the laptop and the arrangement of people suggest a formal or semi-formal gathering for a specific purpose, which aligns with a meeting.

While there is food and drink, the primary activity suggested by the visual cues is not solely consumption but rather a collective activity facilitated by the laptop.",3282,3283," Aha, ein bisschen dickfristiger. vielleicht noch nicht, ich glaube noch nicht, aber ich glaube normalerweise kann man ja unten"

What kind of input? Well by that time the data should be data should be out yeah yeah but if they didn't see the data they didn't have a chance to talk to any of us uh you can put the data but people are not going to really understand what is there yeah so you need to make the call yeah yeah check it out yeah but yeah yeah so i mean we need to to put out the data for the challenge.

"The provided image depicts a table with several items that suggest a leisure activity, specifically **Playing Games**. Here's why:

*   **Snacks and treats:** The presence of chips (Tate's) and candies indicates people are likely gathered for a relaxed activity.
*   **Board game elements:** Although not a full board game, the arrangement of items like what appear to be dice (white cube) and potentially game pieces (colored objects) suggests game components.
*   **Casual setting:** The overall scene with chairs around a table points to a social gathering for entertainment.

Leisure Activities,3205,3467," As in, if you want to propose a topic, that's the first deadline, and if you want to sign up for any topic, that's the second, that's the registration deadline. And then we can facilitate this somehow. We have a workshop chair, no, we have a hackathon chair who is very well versed in running game jams right so uh i assume much of this is going to translate over does he know what he got himself into or uh hopefully no but but one question so so you don't want to give uh concrete topics or tasks? Just examples. Because, for example, the labeling would be really an interesting one. I think the labeling is not really so exciting. I would probably... But it is helpful for us. It's helpful, but... I would probably phrase the whole thing around data data augmentation data exploration yeah yeah so any any topic that people will want to work on should be at least one of those things okay so ideally both yeah so for example something as we discussed that goes into direction of 3d reconstruction or things like that that's that could very well imagine yeah like you do a point cloud you can walk through or you do that that would be nice yeah that for example i can imagine no i mean i guess with real-time abortion splatting technology these days you can probably do some very fancy 40 point cloudy reconstruction-y things and have virtually random perspectives and things like that. But also you can, more from the health perspective, you can say, okay, how well is the posture of the people around you? Skeleton back projection and things like that. So there's probably a lot of very interesting things. Yeah, it's just not helping you. It's much straighter. Things like that. So this is really more of what the call document is supposed to look like. We joked about hangover detection. No, no. Hangover doesn't pass now. No. Who releases the ground truth? I mean the question is what do we want the people to put into a topic proposal? How concrete do we want it to be? How do we judge it? Not too concrete I would say. I think it should have a somewhat concrete goal, As in, what would the team want to have at the end of these 48 hours or because they're gonna they're supposed to present their insights in a 10-minute slot or however long we will find them. Just a second, when would the topic be proposed? Way ahead? On the spot? So I guess for organizational purposes we would probably have a call for topics as in early enough, send us a one-page topic proposal that lists what would be the outcome, what would be the technologies, what would be the data. What kind of input? Well by that time the data should be data should be out yeah yeah but if they didn't see the data they didn't have a chance to talk to any of us uh you can put the data but people are not going to really understand what is there yeah so you need to make the call yeah yeah check it out yeah but yeah yeah so i mean we need to to put out the data for the challenge. So the call for hackathon projects, the deadline for the call for hackathon projects needs to be quite a bit later.

Which is not going to Demos. So we could actually make this AC Multimedia really kind of full of... Yeah, but I mean, just from a logistical point of view, what... Hey, this is... Can we close this thing? Because you can sit there. No, sorry. So logistically... Because something is blowing to my back. Well, if you have the idea, you can sit there. I'm quite happy. He wanted to go green on account of the other people. So what we could do is say, look, every team who actually manages to do a project and to present a project gets a short paper in a hackathon companion proceedings. But this would be similar to a workshop. It's its own proceedings. It's associated with MM. It's not in yeah that would be because the paper submission would then be four weeks after another thing I've been organizing workshops more than once I think, more than once. Most recently..."

And ACM publishing, whatever, will charge S charge CMM something for that, but CMM wanted the hackathon. Yes, right. But let's check it, if it's possible. It's possible. Just tell them that this is what needs to happen and then it will happen somehow. I hope so. Because I know we were breaking spine once with Miriam Reddy, I remember in Brisbane, really to get a paper sometime and it was pretty much like regular proceedings.

That are at least somewhat health related? Some of them. Well, what we said before was to say should be um data exploration and or data augmentation on this paper set and then if you if you want to slant it towards the whole thing in addition to that fair enough and this was just going to be the the criteria by which this is going to be judged because that's what came that workshop. Yeah, but we can put that into the call as an example and say... What happens if nobody comes up with a help-based idea? Then we just throw the hackathon as per CGMN's request. From the very senior people in the field. Let's do a help-based hackathon. No, we're not doing one on......contact, expressions and faces. No, yes. You cannot control what people want to work with. If people are interested in doing other things with a data set, let people also do other things with a data set. But then should we not have ourselves? The thing is, how many people have been at this senior... I've not been invited, I wouldn't know. About 20. So one of these 20 people are then supposed to propose a plan. Yeah, exactly. So now... I understand that they're all busy, but one of them... Well, basically what... Now you should send back mail to them and say, now we have made this, now it's your turn to actually assemble a group to"
Playing Guitar,313,372," work on something so it's a responsibility that something these people are very senior they probably have research groups with lots of people so they can just go to the group and say you five you go to the hackathon and work on this So the catch is, I like that one, and I think it would be, so how the city of Amsterdam did it, and I think those were really nice hackathons, there is not a fake but a clear need. We have these panoramas, and you know, we use them to monitor problems in a public space, this and that state of the assets. But you know, it kind of helps if there are more users, if more departments commit to making something useful out of it. So basically, there is some coordination going on, chief technology officer approached them and all that kind of, people are really interested, genuinely, I have this process and if I can cut two million per year, it's amazing, you know, so they come there and they think look"
Reading,372,373," I guess it's a difference of in terms of the motivation if you work with your own data or data from your own organization or you do something on another data set. So I think here it's more probably we're more targeting the research community which is called and a company saying oh yeah this is a kind of a proxy of the problem we are interested in a bit because then why wouldn't they provide their own data and do a challenge on that? So what I wanted to say is that they did have clear interest it seemed at AC Multimedia kind of to come up with a few very signature use cases, testbeds and so on and this is one of them basically so we could ask because they had clear ideas about example. And they should then, yes, that's what I say. They have vested interest, because that was the part of that.

Specifically for v3c, I could also foresee something that is a variation on a question answering task that essentially says something between question answering and ABS, that you have a find-me instances that answer a particular kind of question, as in show me how to show me examples of i don't know complete sequences of of preparing food right sure yeah not yeah a single clip but they find the audience yeah sure various things no but i think especially there's these kind of aggregation like the how many times did i fly in this year, which airline did I take. So all these things need like a closed set of data and I think this is enabled by a data set like this one. And I think these are tasks that are fairly close to practical challenges.

Playing Guitar,1826,1827," This is also a type of life log. Yes, absolutely. It's a merging of the two somehow. But his dream would be his life log. My dream is my life log. I don't think stationary cameras... No, stationary cameras... There could be. In any way. There could be such a thing as a multi-perspective life log if you say, look, person one has a lot of stationary cameras in their house and spends a lot of time in their house. And person two spends a lot of time abroad or all over the place and is having a wearable camera. And person three does not have a camera at all, but essentially narrates their audio log and takes a bunch of pictures. All of these things could be different forms of live log. Yeah, this is more community live log, more group live log. It's still different to what the LSE open to now has done. It's been a single person.. But is it because this is precisely the challenge that is the best challenge there could be? Or is it because this is the task that could be reasonably made available and therefore the best feasible task that could actually be implemented? As in, if there was instrumentation to record many, many more things, would we want that or do we say no, we want explicitly image sequence thing because for some reason this particular thing is the most interesting. For the LSC challenge, we still do have more multimodal data than anybody actually uses. So it's still there. You can still use the hard writes and all those things if you want to use it. I mean so far there have been very few questions, very few tasks where it would actually be useful. So it's a bit of a chicken and egg thing, right? Yes, yes, yes. I love each process a bit.

Leisure Activities,2212,2214," That's interesting.. to inject this memory injection. And I think we're trying to do some experiments about how this memory injection thing actually represents what we're doing. But we haven't seen a lot of variation on how this is done. So I would actually really propose to say, OK, why don't we have this more conversational style, for example, and say, OK, there's volunteers that are being shown the clips. And then we can see, do they have access to the clip, or are they showing the clip beforehand, and then they actually have to remember? And then they're just there and say, OK, I'm going to describe this to you, and you can shout questions at me. And then maybe we need to have a not everybody shouting at once kind of mechanism. But this would essentially be a new variant of KISS which is less predictable but is inherently more interactive because it is actually back and forth between an intelligent agent as in the person describing what they remember and all the people searching for it. So we should also probably consider that now and that you have an IR maybe that's like for them people are increasingly kind of playing with LLM taking that role so instead instead of having these volunteers, you could actually take a very large model, show it the content alongside the ground truth and actually make it act as some sort of oracle. Well, you don't need the content alongside the ground. I mean, if you describe a ground truth, I think that there's two things here. One thing is you show it the content, but then you rely on the capabilities of that model doing the visual interpretation, which is a bit dangerous, I think. What I could imagine is you try to write it down and then you purely rely on the text of looking up things in that particular text, which for which I think the LLM would be much more reliable. I'm not saying there is one way to do that. Because people are trying, what can they do actually? Given that this is going to be a one-shot interactive thing anyway, I'm much more inclined to actually have a person there. Yeah, I mean why not have a person and have an LLM in parallel just to benchmark that one? Yes, we can also do that. Those could be interesting papers. But to have the... I'm going to ask you something strange because this is how my system happens to work. And the LLM may or may not have ever thought of that. Yeah, yeah. But also this is then a thing of the person. They say, oh, well, let me think. Maybe I remember. Yeah, exactly. We had this thing, for example, as well, if I know that my OCR is very good, then I'm going to pay attention to any little piece of text that's on the screen, even though you probably would never have been to this yeah if you just had seen it in the wild whereas probably if you actually just show it to a person without priming them to oh yeah by the way I have a very good OCR they're just not gonna know yeah exactly or maybe to do or maybe they miss remember yeah but So you know who would know it?
