"Based on the visual evidence in the images, the most appropriate classification for this segment is **Cleaning**.

Here's why:

*   **Presence of cleaning supplies:** The images clearly show cleaning supplies such as cloths (orange cloth in the sink area), sponges, and a bottle of cleaning liquid.
*   **Sink area:** The sink area is visible and appears to be part of a kitchen where cleaning activities would take place.
*   **Trash bin:** A trash bin is present, which is often used during cleaning to discard waste.

While other activities might occur in a kitchen, the prominent display of cleaning materials strongly suggests that cleaning is the primary activity depicted.",3126,3134," thank you i think i'll stick to cookies Das haben wir nicht vergessen.

And then people can... even a two-stage kind of thing as in this if you want to propose a topic that's the first deadline and if you want to sign up for any topic that's a second there's a registration deadline and then we can facilitate this somehow yeah we have a workshop chair and now we have a hackathon chair who is very well versed in running game jams. So I assume much of this is going to translate over. Does he know what he got himself into? No, but one question. So you don't want to give concrete topics or topics? Just examples. Because, for example, the labelling would be really... We started without you. I think the labelling is not really... I would probably... It's helpful for us. I would probably phrase the whole thing around data augmentation and data exploration. So any topic that people will want to work on should be at least one of those things. Ideally both. So for example something that goes in the direction of 3D reconstruction and things like that, that would very well imagine, like you do a point cloud you can walk through or you do Gaussian splats or whatever. That would be nice. That for example, I guess would be nice. I mean I guess with real time Gaussian splatting technology these days you can probably do some very fancy 40 point cloudy reconstruction-y things and have virtually rendered perspectives and things like that. But also you can, more on from the health perspective, you can say, okay, how well is the posture of the people around you, right? Because you can do skeleton back projection and things like that. So there's probably a lot of very interesting things. These chairs are not helping because they are somehow curved.

Well, by that time the data should be out. Yeah, but if they didn't see the data and didn't have chance to talk to any of us, you can put the data but people are not going to really understand what is there. And then they would assume... You need to make the call so that we check it out and so on. But, yeah. Yeah, so, but I mean we need to put out the data for the challenge and so the call for hackathon projects, the deadline for the call for hackathon projects needs to be quite a bit later so people who have have the chance to actually look into this but still early enough that then topics can be sanity checked, can be put on the website and then people can sign up for the hackathon and say I would be interested in working on this and this and this. What time frame do you think is meaningful here? Probably February at least right? It should be... I mean we will have to see how quickly we can actually get all of this out. This needs to go out sometime within the first quarter of 2025. The earlier, the better. But before the end of March. We might be able to announce it and give some insights earlier.

And then there's going to be a, every project will have a lead, a proposer who then commits to actually be there and take part. And then other people can sign up and there's probably going to be some limited quantity of slots and we will have to figure out how many slots we can actually facilitate for this but there's going to be at least a few weeks between the call for projects and the call for for participation even the register I mean even the signing up for the for the hack of all is just part of the conference registration, so this can be even later.

Yeah, yeah, totally, but you are talking about March, April as a deadline for what related to Hackathon? For proposals. Topic proposals. And when is the deadline going to be? There's no paper on Hackathon. No. So chronologically there's things happening in order that first the data set goes out because we also need that for a challenge. Then there's going to be a call for hackathon project proposals that is going to happen sufficiently after this so people actually have a chance to look into this. Afterwards there's going to be a brief review period of these topic proposals to see is this actually something that we think or whoever thinks is feasible to do within the time and resources that we can make available for this. And then there's going to be a, every project will have a lead, a proposer who then commits to actually be there and take part. And then other people can sign up and there's probably going to be some limited quantity of slots and we will have to figure out how many slots we can actually facilitate for this but there's going to be at least a few weeks between the call for projects and the call for for participation even the register I mean even the signing up for the for the hack of all is just part of the conference registration, so this can be even later. And then at some point, we won't have the option of 500 people signing up for this, but there's not going to be 500 people who want to sign up for this. It's probably more of a problem to make it sufficiently broadly known that everybody who might be interested actually knows about this early enough so they could actually take part. It's not something people will look for if you're not going to do it. Sorry, I have no questions. No, because Karhan said there is no paper. Are you sure? We've never done a Hackathon before, right? But what is the motivation then for people to attend? I don't know. Price? But they need some paper for funding the travel, that's what I think. Yeah, in many universities, especially our Asian community, you know, like, you've seen even the opposite. Sometimes people get a paper accepted, but they don't even appear at the conference, the conference. I guess the assumption is that there is already a paper at the conference.

Just a second, when would the topic be proposed? Way ahead? On the spot?

Well, by that time the data should be out. Yeah, but if they didn't see the data and didn't have chance to talk to any of us, you can put the data but people are not going to really understand what is there. And then they would assume... You need to make the call so that we check it out and so on. But, yeah. Yeah, so, but I mean we need to put out the data for the challenge and so the call for hackathon projects, the deadline for the call for hackathon projects needs to be quite a bit later so people who have have the chance to actually look into this but still early enough that then topics can be sanity checked, can be put on the website and then people can sign up for the hackathon and say I would be interested in working on this and this and this. What time frame do you think is meaningful here? Probably February at least right? It should be... I mean we will have to see how quickly we can actually get all of this out. This needs to go out sometime within the first quarter of 2025. The earlier, the better. But before the end of March. We might be able to announce it and give some insights earlier. And then say, okay, you get some bits and pieces. Wait a second, I don't get it.

Yeah, yeah, totally, but you are talking about March, April as a deadline for what related to Hackathon? For proposals. Topic proposals. And when is the deadline going to be?

Afterwards there's going to be a brief review period of these topic proposals to see is this actually something that we think or whoever thinks is feasible to do within the time and resources that we can make available for this. And then there's going to be a, every project will have a lead, a proposer who then commits to actually be there and take part. And then other people can sign up and there's probably going to be some limited quantity of slots and we will have to figure out how many slots we can actually facilitate for this but there's going to be at least a few weeks between the call for projects and the call for for participation even the register I mean even the signing up for the for the hack of all is just part of the conference registration, so this can be even later. And then at some point, we won't have the option of 500 people signing up for this, but there's not going to be 500 people who want to sign up for this.

But, you know, it kind of helps if there are more users, if more departments commit to making something useful out of it. So, basically, there is some coordination going on.

So, they come there and they think, look, it doesn't have to, it can be vague, I said it already, like, advertisement, public advertisement is just wild west, you know, like, so, can we get it from panoramas, you know, like, if that panorama is recorded a few times per month, we can. So, do something with that, you don't have to be. Yeah, but I guess there's there's a difference of in terms of the motivation if you work with your own data or data from your own organization or you do something on another data set so i think here it's more probably we're more targeting the research community with this call than a company saying oh yeah this is a kind of a proxy of the problem we are interested in a bit because then why wouldn't they provide their own data and do a challenge on that? So what I wanted to say is then they did have clear interest it seemed at AC Multimedia kind of to come up with a few very signature use cases, test beds and so on and this is one of them basically so we could ask because they had clear ideas about his agents for example about health care yes that's what I said they have vested interest because that was the part of that yeah but there's also research I think you can't compare it with your example of the end users bringing an interest or someone in the research community be interested but anyway they can bring the topic yes so at least we did the work we will facilitate this and then we play the ball back to them and say look if you want concrete topics around this area then you go and make it happen. We gave you the data, we gave you the framework, we gave you the location, we even ordered the catering right and you just show up and make it happen or send your people yeah don't show up dissolve right i was more thinking like how often are those steering type of meetings i'm guessing annually because this is the first time there's a particular meeting no no but last year oh yeah that not happening before. It's not a series meeting. Uh-huh, so I was just like thinking, okay, maybe, yeah, let's see, but I think people may be interested in kind of chipping in with some ideas. Okay, so let's see how many topics we get. I mean, what you can still do if you see that there is few submissions or there is no topics covered, directly approach some people and say, don't you want to propose a topic for this?

No, no, no, not now. Yes. We are not gonna finish this. You know what's bizarre? You know what's bizarre? We are now helping the planet by charging this with electricity, but we are also cooling the home, so the heating is working harder, so I think we that kind of... to be a healthcare one that they figure out based on this dataset. Here's details of the dataset. Other people can propose hackathons as well. Well, topics. Topics for the hackathon. So the hackathon is based on this dataset? The hackathon is one thing. There is one hackathon. It is going to be... So this particular hackathon is going to use this particular dataset. What happens if there's a second hackathon? There's no second hackathon. What happens if Huawei Dublin convinced them, we want to do a hackathon on social media or something? Do we go, yes, fine, of course, welcome, let's do it. Depends on how much money they give you. It has never happened before, so we do not need to plan for this event. Yeah, but basically, if you give enough money, you do... So this is interesting. I think we could have two models that are also justifiable. So our community, our own community, SIGIMEM, decided to have one hackathon that's based on real heterogeneous multimedia data and health-based topics. If anybody else would like hackathon, well, you have to fund it somehow through either awards and apply so that we can check whether it fits. I don't see it happening for this year. I guess this may be something for the year after when people see the hackathon happening and say next year we'd like to do something else. I wouldn't care about this topic this year. Given that this never happened before, I don't expect that people will just run in our doors and say, oh, I want to host another hackathon at your venue. Because the great success of the hackathon that hasn't happened yet inspired me to do that. So I don't think this is something we need to worry about. And on the off chance that somebody actually comes, then we will figure out what to do. Yeah, I agree. But there's a single hackathon. There's a single hackathon. There's the SIGMEM sponsored hackathon around the dataset that is being created at this very moment. Yes, you're actually on camera in case you haven't noticed. But Luca, I have just one request. Because you mentioned also it could be some gaming related topic. Well, it's more of a motivation-y kind of thing. Sorry? This is more of a motivation-y kind of thing. Motivation, yeah, but that's what I told to Matthias also. Make it playful. Yeah, but why not? I mean, people could... I mean, you could... I was thinking more of gamification than of actual video games, but if somebody wants to make a video game out of this somehow... You could have animated characters from all of us. Yeah, sure. Sounds awesome. The enthusiasm. No, I mean... It's got... I would try and set as few constraints as possible and then just let people run with it. And just essentially set the balance that this is actually realistic. that we think that this has a reasonable chance of succeeding within the parameters we can enable. But I was just saying that it does not need to be in relation to our dataset. No, it should be in relation to the dataset. I guess you can make any gamification approach out of it, like for example trying to... I mean, and this could even be health related, right? I mean, you find... Or you try to mine patterns of incentives for, I don't know, for moving, for drinking less alcohol, for whatever. And you try to make a game out of that. I guess it should at least be applicable to the dataset and demonstrated based on the dataset. So even if you have a thing and say I'm going to do gamified data organization that is directly applicable to any video stream, then that is great. It is also applicable to this video stream and you're supposed to demonstrate that it is at least among other things applicable to this okay i'll write an email summarizing all of that i want it by everybody i wrote some notes i think that's one of the exercises and i will send it to alan alberto and ramesh who were organizing it. Here's what we came up with. And basically, there was the talk of data augmentation, data visualization or representation, but you could have kind of orthogonal, say health would be one of the things. Health is going to be figured out anyway. You don't have to want health, but there's other ones. So just a second, now we diverged. First first you said that all solutions all the work has to be held related no no no no there must be a health related yeah it's an option to make health related health is one of the topics of interest yes it is the thing we're going to suggest courage having one encourage this is gonna have a health angle if people really say no but I really want to do 40 point cloud caution splattering whatever then let them do 40 point cloud caution splattering okay so we have a data set and a facilitation process to support this and we can incentivize by saying that one of the awards is gonna go to"

There is one hackathon. It is going to be... So this particular hackathon is going to use this particular dataset. What happens if there's a second hackathon? There's no second hackathon. What happens if Huawei Dublin convinced them, we want to do a hackathon on social media or something? Do we go, yes, fine, of course, welcome, let's do it. Depends on how much money they give you. It has never happened before, so we do not need to plan for this event. Yeah, but basically, if you give enough money, you do... So this is interesting. I think we could have two models that are also justifiable. So our community, our own community, SIGIMEM, decided to have one hackathon that's based on real heterogeneous multimedia data and health-based topics. If anybody else would like hackathon, well, you have to fund it somehow through either awards and apply so that we can check whether it fits. I don't see it happening for this year. I guess this may be something for the year after when people see the hackathon happening and say next year we'd like to do something else. I wouldn't care about this topic this year. Given that this never happened before, I don't expect that people will just run in our doors and say, oh, I want to host another hackathon at your venue. Because the great success of the hackathon that hasn't happened yet inspired me to do that. So I don't think this is something we need to worry about. And on the off chance that somebody actually comes, then we will figure out what to do. Yeah, I agree. But there's a single hackathon. There's a single hackathon.

Motivation, yeah, but that's what I told to Matthias also. Make it playful. Yeah, but why not? I mean, people could... I mean, you could... I was thinking more of gamification than of actual video games, but if somebody wants to make a video game out of this somehow... You could have animated characters from all of us. Yeah, sure. Sounds awesome. The enthusiasm. No, I mean... It's got... I would try and set as few constraints as possible and then just let people run with it. And just essentially set the balance that this is actually realistic. that we think that this has a reasonable chance of succeeding within the parameters we can enable. But I was just saying that it does not need to be in relation to our dataset. No, it should be in relation to the dataset. I guess you can make any gamification approach out of it, like for example trying to... I mean, and this could even be health related, right? I mean, you find... Or you try to mine patterns of incentives for, I don't know, for moving, for drinking less alcohol, for whatever. And you try to make a game out of that. I guess it should at least be applicable to the dataset and demonstrated based on the dataset. So even if you have a thing and say I'm going to do gamified data organization that is directly applicable to any video stream, then that is great. It is also applicable to this video stream and you're supposed to demonstrate that it is at least among other things applicable to this okay i'll write an email summarizing all of that i want it by everybody i wrote some notes i think that's one of the exercises and i will send it to alan alberto and ramesh who were organizing it. Here's what we came up with. And basically, there was the talk of data augmentation, data visualization or representation, but you could have kind of orthogonal, say health would be one of the things. Health is going to be figured out anyway. You don't have to want health, but there's other ones. So just a second, now we diverged. First first you said that all solutions all the work has to be held related no no no no there must be a health related yeah it's an option to make health related health is one of the topics of interest yes it is the thing we're going to suggest courage having one encourage this is gonna have a health angle if people really say no but I really want to do 40 point cloud caution splattering whatever then let them do 40 point cloud caution splattering okay so we have a data set and a facilitation process to support this and we can incentivize by saying that one of the awards is gonna go to"

So we've been doing LSE. We've been doing VBS for several years now. We have grown the data sets that are used for these benchmarks. And with the new data sets, we also have new variations on type of tasks that we can do. Given such a dataset as this, and possibly even whatever might come after this, what directions do we foresee? What are consequences for these challenges that we foresee, that new opportunities that would open up? And what would we need to do to make that happen? I mean, clearly one opportunity I see is, I think we all find question answering tasks very interesting and having especially these complex and aggregating question answering tasks for example on v3c this is not really possible because of the diversity of things you can't ask the question across the entire data set unless you have really watched everything While here you have a closed world and you have certain constraints to know That something has happened or has not happened and if it has happened these are the places to check So you could more easily have these kind of question answering queries that need to draw information from various types of the content. I mean, yes, specifically for v3c, I could also foresee something that is a variation on a question answering task that essentially says something between question answering and ADS that you have a find me instances that answer a particular kind of question as in yeah show me how to show me examples of I"

*   **Dishes and Utensils:** While there are many dishes, the context of flour and cooking tools points more towards the preparation of food rather than just general dishwashing.

Discussing,1690,1722," answering tasks and removing the medical data set maybe again and removing also the MVK again. But I mean this is a good direction to plan the next generation of challenge data set because v3c was primarily designed for track width, so I had quite some discussions with the people behind track width, specifically the ADS track at track width to see, okay, what is it they would want and need from this. And then it was mostly, oh, we have this new thing we might as well use it for VDS as well. Given that a new one is coming up within the foreseeable future anyway we could do some explicit scoping of the requirements and then see what we would need to design for this for the foreseeable future of properties we already know and probably by by the time we're through with it, it's going to be obsolete anyway, because there's going to be new questions that require new types of data. Yeah, I fully agree with that. And in addition, I think if we have one dataset only for VPS, it would definitely simplify everything, or even the barrier to go into the competition. I mean, just restricting task types so as you say maybe keeping one for QA and then maybe having visual non-item search still for specific types of data. Or maybe for LSE.

Discussing,2388,2442," And I mean we're trying to do some experiments how well this memory injection thing actually represents what we're doing. But we haven't seen a lot of variation on how this is done. So I would actually really propose to say, okay, why don't we have this more conversational style, for example, and say, say okay there's there's volunteers that are being shown the clips yeah and then we can see do they have access to the clip or they're showing the clip beforehand and then they actually have to remember remember and then they're just there and say okay I'm gonna describe this to you and you can shout questions at me and then maybe we need to have a not everybody shouting at once kind of mechanism but this would essentially be a new variant of kiss yeah which is less predictable but is is inherently more interactive because it is actually back and forth between an intelligent agent as in a person describing what they remember and all the people searching for it. So we should also probably consider that now and that you have an IR maybe that's like for them, people are increasingly kind of playing with LLM taking that role so instead of having these volunteers you could actually take a very large model show it the content alongside the ground truth and actually make it act as some sort of oracle well you don't need the content alongside the graph I mean if you describe it ground, I think that there's two things here. One thing is you show it the content, but then you rely on the capabilities of that model doing the visual interpretation, which is a bit dangerous, I think. What I could imagine is you try to write it down and then you purely rely on the text of looking up things in that particular text, which for which I think the LLM would be much more reliable. I'm not saying there is one way to do that because people are playing game what can they do actually. Given that this is gonna be a one-shot interactive thing anyway I'm much more inclined to actually have a person there. Yeah I mean why not have a person and have an LLM in parallel just to benchmark that one yes well we can we can also do that that could be interesting papers later but to to have the i'm gonna ask you something strange because this is how my system happens to work and the the llm may or may not have ever um thought of that yeah but the but but also this is then a thing of the person, they say, oh, well, let me think, maybe I remember or maybe I don't. We had this thing, for example, as well, if I know that my OCR is very good, then I'm going to pay attention to any little piece of text that's on the screen, even though you probably would never a real attention to this yeah if you just had seen it in the world whereas probably if you actually just show it to a person without priming them to oh yeah by the way I have a very good OCR they're just not gonna know yeah exactly or maybe they do or maybe they misremember yeah but then you have... So you know who would know it? If you provide your paper, like let's say VBS submission to a large model, it could pick up what the components are probably even better than... No, but the large model does either know or it doesn't, right? So it's not going to pay attention differently based on the papers you primed it either it either has the visual capabilities of extracting this information or it doesn't yeah and probably something OCR e is is way lower in the semantic hierarchy so it will have a much easier job of simply was there any text on the screen this is all the the text I remember seeing on the screen. Whereas, was this shot in southern Europe? And so, well, how would I know, right? I mean, and there's really, I mean, we had a summer intern working on video to text this summer, and exactly this point that you mentioned of named places, this is something where you would compare different models and they differ a lot. Some never fix any location, others always give you a location. Sometimes it's right, sometimes it's wrong. So these things you really see like did they have some geo-referenced data in the training or how much of that did they have. but yeah but but I mean I like this idea and I think it's really... I like it also because it highlights the importance of doing that in the interactive session. This is not something you can do asynchronously. Whether you do it with people or with models, the answers will never be the same. So you have to do that in the interactive challenge. So it would be reasonably easy to implement. Yeah. The only thing that we would need to make sure is that there is some sort of audio video recording of the event so we actually have a record of this dialogue that happened. Because otherwise you just put the same thing into the race and just as a hint you leave it empty and you have a person there who is instructed to answer these questions and the system still will know what the ground truth is and will judge accordingly. Yeah I guess the question is also like how to design it maybe it could be like a panel of people there who do this answering just to balance memory capabilities of people some people being better at visual things some people better at conceptual things so maybe having like a panel of three people there and together they answer and they also have to agree what they answer. What is the practical scenario and practical research question? Something like this is much closer to the scenario of you having the memory and needing to investigate a system or even imagine way back when we had archivists for this sort of thing that would be the only ones having access to the collection. You're walking up to the archivist and say look I need this type of footage from way back when I know I've seen it and then it's a okay let me help you try to find. What was it about? And what you do is you equalize conditions because we have these cases where we thought about showing people video clips before and then have their memory, let it find it, but then it depends on the memory capabilities, visual memory capabilities of the individual participant. Here you make level this for all, you have the same visual memory for all. Yeah, and I mean what we could even do is have, give the person some visualizer thing or something, they can draw things on the whiteboard or on the flip chart and say oh yeah it was sort of like this and there was this person over there. Because we also have the differences especially when for the for the textual tasks there's on the one hand the cultural and the knowledge context so if you say a particular thing it invokes a different image in my mind then might invoke in somebody else's. There's also different levels of how visual people are actually thinking, so how much of an image this actually invokes and probably all of this somehow feeds into the process and it's very hard to quantify how and to what degree and we have so far never even attempted this because it is how would you even design this. But if you have another person serving as proxy for this, it at least og við hefum þátt að nefna ekki þetta að hægt, því að hvað er það að það þátt að það þ and not everybody can shout questions at the same time. But I mean, we still see many tasks are solved way ahead of the time limit so it might get us a more spread field and closer to the time limit. We could just set the maximum time higher and if we are done, we are done. Yeah, I probably increased the maximum time just to be sure and then see how much we actually need. We've talked we've talked about this a few things, like ideally you would have infinite working time until the last team submitted because then you really know a more precise ranking, but for practical reasons we cut off somewhere, right? I mean, the point is that if there's too much time pressure, people would not be as much inclined to use this aspect. That's true, that's true. Yeah, I mean that's what he also... þá er það ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki busy with your thing, right?

I'm not saying there is one way to do that because people are playing game what can they do actually. Given that this is gonna be a one-shot interactive thing anyway I'm much more inclined to actually have a person there. Yeah I mean why not have a person and have an LLM in parallel just to benchmark that one yes well we can we can also do that that could be interesting papers later but to to have the i'm gonna ask you something strange because this is how my system happens to work and the the llm may or may not have ever um thought of that yeah but the but but also this is then a thing of the person, they say, oh, well, let me think, maybe I remember or maybe I don't. We had this thing, for example, as well, if I know that my OCR is very good, then I'm going to pay attention to any little piece of text that's on the screen, even though you probably would never a real attention to this yeah if you just had seen it in the world whereas probably if you actually just show it to a person without priming them to oh yeah by the way I have a very good OCR they're just not gonna know yeah exactly or maybe they do or maybe they misremember yeah but then you have... So you know who would know it? If you provide your paper, like let's say VBS submission to a large model, it could pick up what the components are probably even better than... No, but the large model does either know or it doesn't, right? So it's not going to pay attention differently based on the papers you primed it either it either has the visual capabilities of extracting this information or it doesn't yeah and probably something OCR e is is way lower in the semantic hierarchy so it will have a much easier job of simply was there any text on the screen this is all the the text I remember seeing on the screen. Whereas, was this shot in southern Europe? And so, well, how would I know, right? I mean, and there's really, I mean, we had a summer intern working on video to text this summer, and exactly this point that you mentioned of named places, this is something where you would compare different models and they differ a lot. Some never fix any location, others always give you a location. Sometimes it's right, sometimes it's wrong. So these things you really see like did they have some geo-referenced data in the training or how much of that did they have. but yeah but but I mean I like this idea and I think it's really... I like it also because it highlights the importance of doing that in the interactive session. This is not something you can do asynchronously. Whether you do it with people or with models, the answers will never be the same. So you have to do that in the interactive challenge. So it would be reasonably easy to implement. Yeah. The only thing that we would need to make sure is that there is some sort of audio video recording of the event so we actually have a record of this dialogue that happened. Because otherwise you just put the same thing into the race and just as a hint you leave it empty and you have a person there who is instructed to answer these questions and the system still will know what the ground truth is and will judge accordingly. Yeah I guess the question is also like how to design it maybe it could be like a panel of people there who do this answering just to balance memory capabilities of people some people being better at visual things some people better at conceptual things so maybe having like a panel of three people there and together they answer and they also have to agree what they answer. What is the practical scenario and practical research question? Something like this is much closer to the scenario of you having the memory and needing to investigate a system or even imagine way back when we had archivists for this sort of thing that would be the only ones having access to the collection. You're walking up to the archivist and say look I need this type of footage from way back when I know I've seen it and then it's a okay let me help you try to find. What was it about? And what you do is you equalize conditions because we have these cases where we thought about showing people video clips before and then have their memory, let it find it, but then it depends on the memory capabilities, visual memory capabilities of the individual participant. Here you make level this for all, you have the same visual memory for all. Yeah, and I mean what we could even do is have, give the person some visualizer thing or something, they can draw things on the whiteboard or on the flip chart and say oh yeah it was sort of like this and there was this person over there. Because we also have the differences especially when for the for the textual tasks there's on the one hand the cultural and the knowledge context so if you say a particular thing it invokes a different image in my mind then might invoke in somebody else's. There's also different levels of how visual people are actually thinking, so how much of an image this actually invokes and probably all of this somehow feeds into the process and it's very hard to quantify how and to what degree and we have so far never even attempted this because it is how would you even design this. But if you have another person serving as proxy for this, it at least og við hefum þátt að nefna ekki þetta að hægt, því að hvað er það að það þátt að það þ and not everybody can shout questions at the same time. But I mean, we still see many tasks are solved way ahead of the time limit so it might get us a more spread field and closer to the time limit. We could just set the maximum time higher and if we are done, we are done. Yeah, I probably increased the maximum time just to be sure and then see how much we actually need. We've talked we've talked about this a few things, like ideally you would have infinite working time until the last team submitted because then you really know a more precise ranking, but for practical reasons we cut off somewhere, right? I mean, the point is that if there's too much time pressure, people would not be as much inclined to use this aspect. That's true, that's true. Yeah, I mean that's what he also... þá er það ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki þá ekki busy with your thing, right?

Talking,3095,3235," When you get those results, basically you would like to know how far is it from the ground truth. And the ground truth is sort of this mental image of what you just described. That's like information need. And Oracle, meaning you and the system, knows that Oracle beforehand because we probably answered it so now there are these tools and they're getting increasingly good you know like in different kind of asking a what is there and not in a dissent or from this set which one Scott so maybe people could just as a help they don't have to, without asking question, they select some examples and submit them there to you and somewhere mid or few times during that process, they get automatic feedback. Whenever it is wrong, they get information about what is wrong. Why is it wrong? Yes, this is a very interesting approach. You could do that also with a human there. You don't have have to automate it it's very heavy you know like meaning especially if you have 16 teams you know you don't want someone to select their one one best 1000 images and tell me what's the threat right yeah yeah i know no no they i guess you can guide that and say you can you can select send one image per minute or so no you could you could even do this, no, the submission process and the scoring process is exactly the same.

So I didn't have it with technology students, like never ever, but now in some tracks I have social sciences students and I think they are also wired a little bit differently so they perceive everything as a bit of negotiation, conversation or maybe kind of just changed you so whenever i make an exam uh there's gonna be a few of them you know like that start aha first i think you have an error in your exam and i'm like no i check them all in a notebook there is no error there it's code it's very simple to check aha are you sure about it i'm like yeah i'm totally sure you know and then it starts yeah but i don't get it why is it not this one and you know that starts really big conversation and you want to kind of remove any un-clarity that's potentially there but then you're always afraid how much did you reveal you know like because to that person you almost solved the question and started like you could say i don't want't want to do it at all, or? I get what you're saying, but this is probably much more of a problem in reality than it would be at such a benchmark because you can more clearly instruct. I mean, it's not really going to be a moment. Generally speaking, you have smarter people you you have people more in tuned with the spirit of the task yeah so are we writing up something about it about the finger or not I would I think this is a this is a great thing we should we should try to have this implemented in 26 yes because that would also require some some actual technical work to be done whereas the other thing is really some so you know what by that time if it's 26 we are already solving some of these things with Hongi like the thing also negative or what if everything is relevant so that's particular one that interests the evangelist a lot because in most cases when you start talking about these conversations all things are irrelevant and you basically have to kind of somehow deal it's none of this it's none of this it's none of this so what do you tell to a team that submitted something that's... I mean it's also doing this for video is probably the... thank you So I write this up... It's the most difficult modality of all the standards modalities we we currently deal with um even if you have a a state-of-the-art vision language model they're not designed for video where they're designed for images and of course you can say okay i do frame selection but if the action is different, if the dynamics are different, then you're not being able to capture this. But this is definitely something that would be very interesting to build, but we would need to essentially build this into the system somehow, so everybody gets consistent replies. And then probably need to deploy this on a more powerful machine. Because even the state of the art vision language models that only do single images as inputs are very heavy. Yeah, I know. But that we can actually, maybe we can also, I suggest that maybe we can collaborate. No, no, no, but I mean we do some more scientific papers on it next year, test it. I have a PhD working on it now, building a simulator basically. I would absolutely be up for that and try to implement this as a type of task for VPS 26. I would still hope to try the... VPS 26 that's in Prague? Yes. I'm TPC Chess so I'll be there as well okay okay right yeah basically helping Honza helping Honza I kind of wasn't next to mm mm you know like and I did a mm already so but he really asked me it's my former PhD student so okay so helping him in cuba basically okay so uh next year somehow we can try this with the we should we should absolutely with hongi we are already building this thing i i don't guarantee how it's gonna end up for uh image and video we have some video data sets and we have some... Meaning primarily we want to... the colleague with whom I supervise him does a lot of text, so for him it's also interesting multimodality and he has more and more PhDs doing multimodality. This is definitely something interesting that... but that requires to invent new things. Yes, there are some. Ask me in two weeks. Ask me in two weeks because Hongi claims that one of these that recently came out is pretty good starting point for that. Yes, absolutely. And building from scratch is anyway infeasible. Unless we have much more data and computer available. Can you unplug? Alright, unplug. Let's do it the other way. You give me this, I move it inside.

So it was blowing so hard that every once in a while they had to go down to repark the car because it would be moving you know like towards the water. The truck? The truck yeah. This was like really what the hell you know. Yeah yeah yeah and on the highway this was really looking I thought because we went on a highway to in the city you have one big sort of garbage where you can kind of bring also electrical appliances that you're not going to use i also gave those we used some we call students for housing or so so that's basically students that kind of have moving as a side job it's pretty large actually one of the largest in the country now started as a moving students you know like but now is de, one of the largest in the country now.

En ole ollut kylmä-ruuhaa Dublina. Ehkä koska... Kylmä-ruuhaa Dublina? Tai täällä? Täällä se on storm is cold red now. Where? Here. Right from 10pm. This happening is cold red. No, this is probably... Yeah, in the evening Hey guys. It's just a normal summer day. So how do we... Can we leave? Can we leave? How do we go about the dinner then? We're going to drive to the bar. By what car? By driving. Only you'll be able to walk to the bar. So we're leaving early because we want to go to Colorado. So Klaus and I walk? Yeah. Because theoretically storm cannot... We're not going to have flooding on the roads of this way. All the way to the town. It's a river, right? But it's on the other side of the town. The town would probably be totally fine. Village. How amphibious is your farm? My car will be okay, we're're not in a rush. Chance's car is the one that's in the rush. Look, chances are you'll be fine. Chances are. Yeah, this is a very, yeah.

But chances are you'll be wrong. That is technically always true. There's a chance that we don't have power in the morning, so get your devices charged. Oooh. It's happening actually tonight. So the way I see it, the worst thing that can happen basically now is for you two guys For you two guys not to have a flight in the morning. But if that happens, they're gonna have to figure you out something. Apparently lots of flights have already been canceled in Amsterdam. The question is how now? If we get that done, not in Dublin.

Ana mi je rekao da je Amstrad uvijek bio uvijek, a kada smo se uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uvijek uv I don't know what it was but 140 190 that was really yeah very insane that was on February there's a quite a big difference between 140 and 190. 140 you can somehow we you know that this happened fairly regularly 190 is very strong, no, I'm saying we have this... We have it in one place. 140 is very rare, 190 is normal. Only in that place. So there was one place in the West, where they have a lot of... But it's, you know, they're drugom.

So they parked it in front of her building. And it was really exposed, you know, like these islands on the east of Amsterdam, there are a few of them. So it was blowing so hard that every once in a while they had to go down to repark the car because it would be moving you know like towards the water. The truck? The truck yeah. This was like really what the hell you know. Yeah yeah yeah and on the highway this was really looking I thought because we went on a highway to in the city you have one big sort of garbage where you can kind of bring also electrical appliances that you're not going to use i also gave those we used some we call students for housing or so so that's basically students that kind of have moving as a side job it's pretty large actually one of the largest in the country now started as a moving students you know like but now is de, one of the largest in the country now. Started as a moving students, you know, but now is de facto one of the largest. Very professional also. We were going to... I gave them what they wanted to take and then we were like, hey, we bring rest to that city... It's not Daphne, you know like because you just like to leave appliances they do something"

I don't know it's already open, but there was a lot of damage around. They say it's about one million of damage, and it will need two days to repair the rail line. Right. Okay. So people are stupid. Yeah, fair enough. Well, on that account, I also felt ridiculous that we had to move then, but you know what's the catch? You have to pay those agencies upfront and already the day before, two days before, we knew it's gonna be code red and this metal alarm, you know, but basically advice is stay at home.

Interactive video retrieval systems. In abstract time or in real time? In real time, of course. Imaginary. Not imaginary time. GPT says to benchmark and evaluate the performance of interactive video search systems in real time. I'm sure it says that on the website somewhere. Question 2. This is an easy one. In what year was the first video browser showed up out? 2012. Yes! Oh my god, why? Question 3. Which international conference often hosts gas trucks? That is technically wrong. I just press it and you answer, whatever. Because it always hosts. Ah, fair enough. Question 4. What is the format of the tasks presented during the DBS? A non-item search. Ad hoc? Question answering. Things like GPT. Oh, the format is such that the teams participate with their proposed and developed systems and each team is supposed to develop a certain number of interactive video retrieval tasks that involve known item search, searching for... Interactive video search tasks where participants locate specific content in large video collections. La, la, la. Question five. What is the dataset commonly used in the VPS for evaluating... What?

No it's inside the snow."

So it actually wouldn't freeze. like in the's like, I've seen it once on TV and some place in Siberia where you would actually get the milk like a loaf of cheese. They just freeze it and then. You cut the milk? Can you cut the milk? How many liters do you need? Two liters. There you go boss. Jā, jā, jā! Jā, jā, jā! Jā, jā, jā, jā! Kādu litru jūt? 2 litri! Tās ir, baši!

I'm just like thinking, as a kid, I don't remember such snows. But in the mountains, around... I do remember having like half a meter of snow during winter. I mean, half a meter one thing you know like he's talking about what two meters. Base level like everywhere in the village was maybe one, one and a half meter. And then you go up from there. Around for example the slaughterhouse which was you know let's say it's almost like a three-story high building and so on you would have a snow drift that you know no snow at the house yeah and then we'll go yeah totally totally totally yeah and you could actually slide on that yeah when we built snow houses we we sometimes made two-story houses but we never actually built we dug yeah yeah so our snow houses were always inside the drift yeah yeah. Just dig inside. But we made sometimes, you know, tunnels inside and so on. I think you've been at Trnovacko lake. On Trnovacko lake in Maglic. When you climbed from Tara, that lake that you climbed on, that's Trnovacko lake. Okay. I think so, yes. Yes, when AS I think so. When us didn't have shoes and so on. Took my mom's. So when you go there in the winter. Like when you go there in the winter. So Milan once told me they went once in the winter. And they were kind of hiking there in that area. So they were looking for that Shepards cottage. So there are cottages. We call it katun, where the shepherds in the summer bring the sheep and then they're, I don't know exactly the month, I'm gonna be lying, but probably October, bring them a little bit down to the villages. So normally that would be the shepherds kind of that live there and make the cheese cheese you know like make kymak kymak is this uh thank you um greasy you know like uh product and so on uh fatty product yeah so they were kind of walking around and looking for that cottage and where was it it was here you know like another they were standing on it. It was totally leveled, not visible. So he was like, it must have been here somewhere. And they're like, they have GPS, they have everything, you know, but they also know visually. That's the rock, you know, like, that's the thing. There is the cottage, you know, like, they did it, they were thinking it was bad weather, you know, like, oh, we are probably somewhere on the roof. There is nobody there, but yeah. I remember also once, he's also in mountain patrol, you know, like there was this family and it was so bad weather that they recommended also families from those villages to go down, you know. I think they kind of refused, you know, like that somebody living a little bit secluded you know like a family i think at that time young children so they lost a bit contact with them so what to do how to do you know like so two of them actually were thinking with cars you cannot go and you know how it is in bosnia with the choppers and everything takes ages to allow it to fly, you know, like, and maybe sometimes it's even political, you know. So now there are forest fires in Foča, like a regional around Suticka National Park. So Serbia does have capabilities and they were really willing to help, but it took days, you know, like to approve it to its different state and then it kind of takes also a little bit admitting, We cannot solve itakaļu, ir ļoti ātri.

They are mostly concerned that the livestock survives. you know, and it's normally not far but not all so close. So it's actually really, you have to dig that trench, let's call it. You have to dig the trench wide enough and good enough so it doesn't collapse on you while you're there.

But if you are really misfortunate to have so much snow, yes So maybe I'm drawing a set of village in September. Yeah, and you pick it up in May And if you want if you need to go somewhere the main roads are here But inside inside the village, it was never cleared. There was no point.
