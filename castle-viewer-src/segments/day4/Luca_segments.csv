If you say, well, we set it up, if I don't need it, but if I need it, I could, yeah. But apparently... But here it's not. Okay. But did you already have this converted? Because I had to actually move the power intake from the house into the garage. Yeah. And at that moment it's now. Yes, no, I mean it makes sense. It had to be moved anyway. Yeah, I mean it makes sense. If you redo the wiring anyway, you might as well just do the electrical panel than I would have, like way less than if I had actually asked them just to connect the three-phase power. Okay. So for moving and switching and doing everything, I paid like one third of what I would have paid for just plugging two wires in. Okay.

So you're essentially having a pole somewhere outdoors to mount the charger to. Okay. On the house, probably. Fair enough. I mean, they're all designed to...

It's your car, so you can sit here. I'm quite happy. He wanted to go green on account of the other people.

Meeting,241,309," Now, my understanding is we're going to have a call for hackathon topics? Yes. That are at least somewhat health-related, some of them. Well, what we said before was to say it should be data exploration and or data augmentation based on this data set. And then if you want to slant it towards the health thing, in addition to that, fair enough. And this was just going to be the criteria by which this is going to be judged. Because that's what came out of that workshop. Yeah, but we can put that into the call as an example and say... What happens if nobody comes up with a health-based idea? Then we've just done a hackathon as per CIMM's request from the very senior people in the field. Let's do a health-based hackathon. Oh, look, we're doing one on contracting expressions on faces the behavior. No. Look, if people are interested in doing other things with a data set,"
Meeting,309,411," So one of these 20 people are then supposed to propose a topic. Yeah, exactly. I understand that they're all busy, but one of them... Now you should send back mail to them and say, now we have made this, now it's your turn to actually assemble a group to work on something, right? Okay. So it's their responsibility. And I mean, even most of these people are very senior, they probably have research groups with lots of people, so they can just go to the group and say, you five, you go to the hackathon and work on this, right? So the catch is, I like that one, and I think it would be, so how the city of Amsterdam did it, and I think those were really nice hackathons, there is not a fate, but a clear need. We have these panoramas, and we use them to monitor problems in a public space, crowdiness, this and that, state of the assets. But you know, it kind of helps if there are more users, if more departments commit to making something useful out of it. So basically, there is some coordination going on, Chief Technology Office approached them, you know, like, people are really interested, genuinely. I have this process and if I can cut 2 million per year, it's amazing, you know. So they come and they think look doesn't have to it can be vague. I said it already like Advertisement public advertisement is just wild west, you know, like so can we get it from panoramas? You know, like if the panorama is recorded few times per month we can So do something with that Yeah I guess the difference in terms of the motivation if you work with your own data or data from your own organization or you do something on another data set. So I think here it's more probably we're more targeting the research community with this call than a company saying oh yeah this is a kind of a proxy of the problem we are interested in a bit because then why wouldn't they provide their own data and do a challenge on that so what i wanted to say is that they did have clear interest it seemed at ac multimedia kind of to come up with a few very signature use cases test beds and so on and this is one of them basically so we could ask because they had clear ideas about his agents, for example. Great, then they should propose. Yes, they have vested interest because that was the part of that. Yeah, but there's also research. I think you can't compare it with your example of the end users bringing an interest or someone in the research community be interested. But anyway, they can bring the topic. Yes, so now we did the work, we will facilitate this, and then we play the ball back to them and say, look, if you want concrete topics around this area, then you go and make it happen. We gave you the data, we gave you the framework, we gave you the location, we even ordered the catering, right? And you just show up and make it happen.

Okay, so let's see how we... This is not a lot of tea. What happens... Let mean, what you can do is you can still do it if you see that there is few submissions or there is no topics covered, directly approach some people and say, don't you want to propose a topic for this? Are you making more tea? Yes. Garbage detection is not good. Yeah. I mean, it's very hard to make data for you. I'm talking about somewhere else. I mean, garbage detection, if you look at this, yeah. If you're cold? I'm not cold, but did you want to go check? You were looking like you were cold. No, I'm not cold. You were driving your car through it. I honestly don't there. I just want to hide the wire out the window. You can put it in my bedroom. I already hate this sustainability. Mine is just in front of the... I'll move the car, then everybody's going to be warm. No, no, no, not now. Let's have a first. Yes, we're going to finish this. Otherwise, this is not going to... hard and everybody is going to be warm right? No, no, no, not now. Yes, we are not going to finish this otherwise this is not going to... You know what's the problem? We are now helping the planet by charging this with electricity, but we are also cooling the homes so the heating is working harder. Although, the building isn't that well insulated anyway. anyway. Exactly. Okay, so let me summarize this to say"
Cooking,828,834," Okay, I'll write an email summarizing all of that. I'll run it by everybody. I wrote some notes. No. No, no, no. There must be a health related. It's an option to make health related. So, health is one of the topics of interest. Yes. It is the thing we're going to suggest. We're going to encourage that this is going to have a health angle. if people really say, no, but I really want to do 40-point cloud Gaussian splattering, whatever, then let them do 40-point cloud Gaussian splattering, or whatever this is called. We have a data set and a facilitation process to support. Yes. Then we can incentivize by saying that one of the awards is going to go to healthcare-related topic. And the rest... No, I think... No. No. I wouldn't even... I guess what you do if you just have one healthcare-related topic. It's like a hackathon. If you have a really bad one. Yeah. No. Give them awards? No. No. I mean... It could be as simple as recipe book generation. Isn't this the one thing? Everybody Everybody gets a medal. Yeah, we're not doing that. Let's not do that. Taking part is its own reward. You're not a millennial, Mene. It doesn't concern you. First of all, of course I am. I think that's okay. That's a moving yellow line. Next in the agenda. Next in the agenda. Next in the agenda was the thinking beyond or trying to apply the learnings and all the discussions back to the things you already have. So we've been doing LSC, we've been doing VBS for several years now. We have grown the data sets that are used for these benchmarks. And with the new data sets, we also have new variations on type of tasks that we can do.

The rule is basically any reasonably understandable description of a system that can, with some shepherding, be turned into a readable paper. So maybe it's time to go back to... Open up that question again for LSE and go, we want this to go part of this conference. That goes back to the steering committee first. Move LSE to AC Martimedia? No, I mean for ICMR. Move it into VBS now. It actually makes a difference. Move it into the main proceeding and just say this is a track. Yes, that would be very good. But that's what I got pushed back on a few years ago so I can try it again. And maybe also integrate the video data set there for the LSE because it fits perfectly to it, right? To the VPS it would also fit because it's video type. But that's the interactive side then really that we focus on the asynchronous stuff for this and the demo, it could even, the data set could possibly even be used in both things, but for different purposes. Because the type of tasks in VBS and LSE are technically, as in how they are implemented, very similar. Semantically, they're still quite different. I mean, to be honest, like if you take, we have a decent share of wedding videos in the data set. I mean, like a group of people being at a wedding is not so different. Yes absolutely but we but we've never done anything with it explicitly right so we we don't have the the the wedding subtask yeah i mean this is something we could possibly do for whatever comes after v3c um if if there are some directions and say well if we we will inevitably run out of v3c, probably within two years or so. So then we might anyway need to design something else that has new properties for interesting challenges that we foresee for the future. Do you see VBS being able to have a track for this data set where somebody can take part but not take part in the VLC data set track? That definitely can fit to VBS because we have so many different types already. I mean, how would you split the track? Yeah, I don't know. Do a separate session?

We know it's extremely hard. Do we need to, or is this now the new site collection that we would go with? Yeah. So I personally would even prefer using only V3C and VPS in the future, but for question answering tasks. Mm-hm. and removing the medical data set maybe again and removing also the MVK again. But I mean this is a good direction to plan the next generation of challenge data set because I mean v3c was primarily designed for track width. So I had quite some discussions with the people behind track width, specifically the AVS track at track width to see, okay, what is it they would want and need from this? And then it was mostly, oh, we have this new thing. We might as well use it for VBS as well.

Cooking,1876,1938, So it's still different to what the LSC up until now has done.
The video segment shows a person in a kitchen with food in a baking dish and various cooking ingredients and appliances. This strongly suggests the activity is **Cooking**.,1938,2001," Thank you. Yes, but is it because this is precisely the challenge that is the best challenge there could be? Or is it because this is the task that could be reasonably made available and therefore the best feasible task that could actually be implemented? As in, if was instrumentation to record many many more things would we want that or do we say no we want explicitly image sequence thing because for for some reason this particular thing is the most interesting. We still do have more multi-modal data than anybody actually uses. You can still use the heart rates and all those things if you want to use it. I mean, so far there have been very few questions, very few tasks where it would actually be useful. So, it's a bit of a chicken and egg thing, right? It's processing it. Yeah. So, I would recommend for LSE that we only keep the image-based dataset because the entry barrier is much lower lower for new teams for as long as that seems sensible right yeah and maybe at ACM multimedia we use this"
Cooking,2001,2054, Yes. So we have the focus kept on the data
"The provided image shows a kitchen scene. There are various items on the countertops that could be associated with cooking or preparing food. The presence of what appears to be a stovetop or cooking surface in the background, along with bottles that might contain cooking ingredients, suggests that the activity taking place is related to food preparation. Given the options, ""Cooking"" is the most fitting category.

The final answer is $\boxed{Cooking}$.",2054,2055,

And in two years' time, or 18 months' time at Castle 2, we go back and say, well, how successful is this POV team? Yes, but I mean, independently of that, I still foresee a future where, several years down the line, LSE might have a very different type of data set, because at that point, there might be variable cameras that essentially essentially do this type of data but they are small enough that you can clip it to a shirt and wear it all the time first ever lifelike challenge we did at ntcir was from three people for a month each right we actually did start off with more people but just it became more of a headache to keep that going right it became two people became one person so so put on the camera yeah so there will be lunch ready in about 10 minutes can i just write up something uh can I try to summarize what I heard? Yes. LSE, VBS and ACMMM Grand Challenge slash Hackathon should be having unique signatures. VBS is VBS. Let's put it, so let's say with LSE, which is kind of smallest in scope, LSE should be focused on personal and love for data, there should be a task that's visual only to provide, I would say, a low threshold for participation, but nobody prevents people from using also the other data such as geocognites and so on and so on. I think it would be interesting to have tasks that actually work. Yes, at least to think a few, you know, like a... Yeah, on the other hand, I guess we deliberately sometimes avoiding tasks that are easy to solve with geolocation or things like that. Yeah, but I'm saying, you know, elevate, high trade, or elevation or something like this. Those things, yes, but more rare. But I mean, especially for ad hoc kind of queries, it might also be interesting to do more of a when did I exert myself on the weekend kind of things right which you don't necessarily get from the images yeah things like this so so essentially so essentially there's there's a an aim towards more semantic distinction of the of the different events so so let's see smell you check it out yeah i checked it it looks pretty okay hey but uh with these ovens i have to tell you it looks like nothing is happening and then then all a sudden but also from a purely task implementation point of view I mean we already talked about this I don't know yesterday or two days ago that even the way the tasks are phrased or are conducted have quite some room for design variations. So the motivation behind instant search, known item search, the way I always understood it was a, oh, I've seen this thing before somewhere at the point in time"

And somewhere mid or few times during that process, they get automatic feedback. So whenever it is wrong, they get information about what is different. Yes, this is a very interesting approach. But you could do that also with a human there. You don't have to automate it. It's very heavy, you know, like knitting. No, you would have to limit it. I mean, you don't want someone to select the best 1,000 images and tell them what's the thread, right? Yeah, yeah, I know, I know. I guess you can guide it and say you can send one image. No, I mean, you could even do this and say, no, the submission process and the scoring process is exactly the same. But rather than just getting the feedback, your submission was correct, your submission was not correct, every time it was not correct, you're also getting more information back because this is also more what would happen if you were to talk to the archivist and say, is it this? No, it's similar, but it's's not like and these are the attributes yes the difficult thing is then you're giving information to one team you don't give it the same information to everyone yes so this so this this are two independent things both of them are interesting I would kind of want to try. One of them is much more easy to implement than the other because this diffing thing would actually need to be built whereas the other is really just... it needs a volunteer and they need to be shown some clips. But this is a very interesting idea. You know what's the problem with volunteer. I can tell you that. So, I didn't have it with technology students, like never ever, but now in some texts I have social sciences students. And I think they are also valued a little bit differently, so I perceive everything as a bit of negotiation, conversation, or maybe kind of just change, you know. So whenever I make an exam, there is going to be a few of them, you know, like, that start first. How do they already have food? I think we have another one. And I'm like, no, it's not in the notebook. There is no error here. It's good. It's very simple to check. Are you sure about that? Yeah, I'm totally sure. Then you don't need a new glass. I don't get it. Why is it not this one? And, you know, it starts a really big conversation, and you want to remove any un-clarity that's potentially there. But then you're always afraid how much did you really do. Yes, I... Because to that person, you almost solved the question and started, like... You could say, I don't want to do it at all. I get what you're saying, but this is probably much more of a problem in reality than it would be at such a benchmark because you can more clearly instruct. I mean, it's not really going to be a volunteer. You have smarter people... You have people more in tuned with the spirit of the task. Yeah, fair enough.

Unclear,3302,3325," Thank you.

So now there are these tools and they're getting increasingly good, you know, like different kind of asking, hey, what is there and not in this set or from this set. So maybe people could, it doesn't help, they don't have to use it, without asking questions, they select some examples and submit them to you. And somewhere mid or few times during that process, they get automatic feedback. So whenever it is wrong, they get information about what is different. Yes, this is a very interesting approach. But you could do that also with a human there. You don't have to automate it. It's very heavy, you know, like knitting. No, you would have to limit it. I mean, you don't want someone to select the best 1,000 images and tell them what's the thread, right? Yeah, yeah, I know, I know. I guess you can guide it and say you can send one image. No, I mean, you could even do this and say, no, the submission process and the scoring process is exactly the same. But rather than just getting the feedback, your submission was correct, your submission was not correct, every time it was not correct, you're also getting more information back because this is also more what would happen if you were to talk to the archivist and say, is it this? No, it's similar, but it's's not like and these are the attributes yes the difficult thing is then you're giving information to one team you don't give it the same information to everyone yes so this so this this are two independent things both of them are interesting I would kind of want to try. One of them is much more easy to implement than the other because this diffing thing would actually need to be built whereas the other is really just... it needs a volunteer and they need to be shown some clips. But this is a very interesting idea. You know what's the problem with volunteer. I can tell you that. So, I didn't have it with technology students, like never ever, but now in some texts I have social sciences students. And I think they are also valued a little bit differently, so I perceive everything as a bit of negotiation, conversation, or maybe kind of just change, you know. So whenever I make an exam, there is going to be a few of them, you know, like, that start first. How do they already have food? I think we have another one. And I'm like, no, it's not in the notebook. There is no error here. It's good. It's very simple to check. Are you sure about that? Yeah, I'm totally sure. Then you don't need a new glass. I don't get it. Why is it not this one? And, you know, it starts a really big conversation, and you want to remove any un-clarity that's potentially there.

That explains so many things. No, no, wait a second. Can you read the question? This is typical judgment. Ask the yeah, yeah. Question and answer it in Russian. It's not a Barrytown trilogy, it's Barrytown. But it's really Kilbarrack, which is the proper name. Question 11. Bonus question that Kachel is not allowed to answer.

*   **Papers and documents:** The presence of papers suggests an agenda, notes, or shared materials, all typical of a meeting.
*   **Engaged discussion:** The individuals appear to be interacting and focused, indicative of a discussion-based meeting.
*   **Diverse group:** The group appears to be a mix of individuals, which is common in many types of meetings.

"The image provided shows a person's hands holding a cardboard box over a dining table that is set with red placemats and plates. The overall scene suggests preparation for an event or activity. Without additional context, it's difficult to definitively classify the activity. However, considering the elements present:

*   **Dining table set:** Indicates a meal or gathering.
*   **Cardboard box:** Could contain decorations, gifts, or items for an activity.
*   **Christmas tree in the background:** Suggests a festive occasion, potentially Christmas.

Given these observations, the most fitting classification among the provided options would be **Leisure Activities**. This is because the setting and items suggest a non-essential, enjoyable activity rather than a chore or work-related task.

**Reasoning:**

The background is a white shelving unit with dividers. There is also a dark surface below the shelf, which could be the top of a appliance or piece of furniture.

Given the limited information, it's difficult to definitively classify the activity. However, the presence of the plastic bag could suggest it's related to food storage or disposal, or perhaps cleaning supplies. Without more context, it's hard to determine the specific action.
