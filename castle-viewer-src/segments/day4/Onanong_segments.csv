I mean I guess with real-time Gaussian splatting technology these days you can probably do some very fancy 4 point cloudy reconstruction II things and and have virtually rendered perspectives and things like that yeah but also you can more on from the from the health perspective you can say okay how well is the posture of the people around yeah right yeah yeah skeleton back projection and things like that so there's probably a lot of very"

Several people appear to be present in the background, and the overall atmosphere suggests a mealtime or a gathering for food and drinks. Therefore, the most fitting category is **Eating**.",3076,3135," because you will need at least one entire day, maybe even two. Yeah, two days. And yeah, doing that during the conference will mean people miss half of the conference. Yes, and the people who actually come for the conference probably will not want to do that. So, I mean is... This is logistics. This is... To be... So the important question is how long is it? How long is it? Today. Probably. 48 hours or something. Is this like a regular hackathon that we... Okay, it Most people will not sleep. It's probably like an irregular hackathon. So what do we expect to be a reasonable amount of work or a reasonable challenge for two days? To have something that you can actually present and show. I mean I wouldn't put a complete challenge. That's up to the people who people who actually want to. Oh, then what do we have to discuss? I mean, the question is probably topically, like Carl was talking about, some health-related thing, if you want to guide it into that direction. I mean, the simplest thing is do something interesting with the data in 48 hours. That like the general I would I would still give some examples of people could work on and then I would have a call for participation as in a sign up thing and you can propose exactly projects and then people can maybe even a two stage kind of thing as in if you want to propose a topic that's the first deadline and if you want to sign up for any topic that's the second, there's a registration deadline and then we can facilitate this somehow. We have a workshop chair, no we have a hackathon chair who is very well versed in running game jams, so I assume much of this is going to translate over. Does he know what he got himself into? No. No, but one question, so you don't want to give concrete topics or tasks? Just examples. Because for example the labelling would be really interesting. The labelling is not really as exciting as I thought. I would probably phrase the whole thing around data augmentation and data exploration. So any topic that people will want to work on should be at least one of those things. Ideally both. So for example something as we discussed that goes into the direction of 3D reconstruction and things like, that I could very well imagine. Like you do a point cloud you can walk through or you do Gaussian splats or whatever. That would be nice. I mean I guess with real-time Gaussian splatting technology these days you can probably do some very fancy 4 point cloudy reconstruction II things and and have virtually rendered perspectives and things like that yeah but also you can more on from the from the health perspective you can say okay how well is the posture of the people around yeah right yeah yeah skeleton back projection and things like that so there's probably a lot of very"
"The image depicts a person in a kitchen environment, which strongly suggests activities related to **Cooking**.",3135,3629," How concrete do we want the people to put into a topic proposal? How concrete do we want it to be? How do we judge it? I cannot do concrete I would say. I think it should have a somewhat concrete goal as in what would the team want to have at the end of these 48 hours or however long this is actually going to be because they're supposed to present their insights in 10 minutes or however long we will find. Just a second. When would the topic be proposed? Way ahead? On the spot? So I guess for organizational purposes, we would probably have a call for topics, as in early enough, send us a one-page topic proposal that lists what would be the outcome, what would be the technologies, what would be the data. Well Well, by that time the data should be out. Yeah, but if they didn't see the data, didn't have chance to talk to any of us, you can put the data, but people are not going to really understand what is there. So you need to make the call so that they check it out. Yeah, but I mean we need to put out out the data for the for the challenge anyway so the the call for for hackathon projects the deadline for the call for hackathon projects needs to be quite a bit later so people who have have the chance to actually look into this but still early enough that then topics can be uh sanity checked can be put on the website and then people can sign up for the hackathon and say I would be interested in working on this and this and this topic. What time frame do you think is meaningful here? Probably February at least, right? It should be signed out. I mean we will have to see how quickly we can actually get all of this out. This needs to go out sometime within the first quarter of 2025. The earlier the better. But before the end of March. We might be able to announce it and give some insights earlier and then say okay, you get some bits and pieces. Just a second, I don't get it. If I may, just like you took March, normally submission for regular papers is the end of April. Like that's going to be seven or something. But this can be much later. Yeah, yeah, totally. But you are talking about March, April as a deadline for what? A call for proposers. So we will, so chronologically... When is the deadline going to be? There's no paper on Hackathon. No. So chronologically there's things happening in order that first the data set goes out because we also need that for the challenge. Then there's going to be a call for hackathon project proposals that is going to happen sufficiently after this so people actually have a chance to look into this. Afterwards, there's going to be a brief review period of these topic proposals to see is this actually something that we think or whoever thinks is"

We will probably end up giving them the dates, and we'll give them a third set of dates for the Hackathon publication. Do you think it's possible? Yeah, with a targeted publication date of end of the year or something. It's just impossible to do it any other way, unless you run the Hackathon two months early. That doesn't make sense. That's not happening. Now, my a cup my understanding is gonna have a call for hackathon topics yes that are at least some of what health related some of them well yeah well we what we said before was to say it should be data exploration and or data augmentation based on this data set and then if you want to slant it towards the health thing in addition to that fair enough and this was just going to be the criteria by which this is going to be judged. Because that's what came out of that workshop. Yeah, but we can put that into the call as an example and say... What happens if nobody comes up with a health-based idea? Then we've just done the hackathon as per CIGMM's request from the very senior people in the field, so let's do a health-based hackathon. Oh, look, we're doing one on tracking expressions on faces. No, yes. Just the movie. No. You cannot control what people want to do. If people are interested in doing other things with a data set, let people also do other things with a data set. Then should we not have ourselves a health cycle? Yes, but the thing is, how many people have been at this senior... I've not been invited. I wouldn't know, right? About 20. Yeah. so one of these 20 people are then supposed to propose a topic. Yeah, exactly. So now... I understand that they're all busy, but one of them... Well, basically what... Now you should send back mail to them and say, now we have made this, now it's your turn to actually assemble a group to work on something, right? Okay. So it's their responsibility. And I mean, even most of these people are very senior. They probably have research groups with lots of people, so they can just go to the group and say, you five, you go to the hackathon and work on this. So the catch is, I like that one, and I think it would be, so how the city of Amsterdam did it, and I think those were really nice hackathons, there is not a fake but a clear need. We have these panoramas and we use them to monitor problems in a public space, crowdiness, this and that, state of the assets and all that. But you know, it kind of helps if there are more users, if more departments commit to making something useful out of it. So basically, there is some coordination going on, the chief technology officer approaches them and all that kind of, people are really interested, genuinely, I have this process and if I can cut two million per year, it's amazing, you know. So they come there and they think look It doesn't have to it can be vague. I said it already like Advertisement public advertisement is just wild west, you know, like so can we get it from panoramas? You know, like if the panorama is recorded few times per month we can So do something with that Yeah I guess's the difference of in terms of the motivation if you work with your own data or data from your own organization or you do something on another data set. So I think here it's more probably we're more targeting the research community with this call than a company saying oh yeah this is a kind of a proxy of the problem we are interested in a bit because then why wouldn't they provide their own data and do a challenge on that? So what I want to say is that they did have clear interest it seemed at AC Multimedia kind of to come up with a few very signature use cases, testbeds and so on and this is one of them basically so we could ask because they had clear ideas about his agents for example yeah that's what i said yeah they have vested interest because that was the part of that yeah but there's also research i think you can't compare it with your example of the end users bringing an interest or someone in the research community be interested but anyway they can bring the topic yes so so now we we did the work we will facilitate this and then we play the ball back to them and say look, if you want concrete topics around this area, then you go and make it happen. We gave you the data, we gave you the framework, we gave you the location, we even ordered the catering, right? And you just show up and make it happen. Or send your people if you don't show up yourself. I was more thinking like how often are those steering type of meetings? I'm guessing annually because this is the first time there's a particular meeting. No no no but last year oh yeah that was not happening before. It's not a steering committee meeting. So I was just like thinking, okay, maybe, yeah, let's see, but I think there are people maybe interested in a kind of chipping in with some ideas. Okay, so let's see how many topics. What happens? I mean, what you can still do if you see that there is a few submissions or there is no topics covered, directly approach some people and say, do you want to propose a topic? Yes. Stefan, maybe you can propose garbage detection or something? Yeah. We've got a very high-tech elevator for you. I'll plug it in somewhere else. I mean, garbage detection. Switch? Yes. Yeah. I'm okay. If you're cold? I'm not cold, but if you want to switch, I can. No, no, I was just asking. Because you were looking like you were cold. No, I'm not cold. If somebody gives me their bedroom... You will drive your car into it and... I want to hang... My mind is on the ground. You also have a master bedroom bedroom, no problem. I already hate this sustainability. My money is just in front of the carpet. I'll move the card and everybody's going to be warm, right? No, no, no, not now. We're the first! We are not gonna finish this, otherwise this is not gonna... You're staying here! You know what's bizarre? We are now helping the planet by charging this with electricity but we are also cooling the home so the heating is working harder so I think we already kind of... Oh don't worry, the building isn't that well insulated anyway. Exactly. Okay, so let me summarize this to say we have decided on some kind of a process to which a hackathon takes place. One of those hackathons will be suggested to senior SIG-MM people to be a healthcare one that they figure out based on this dataset. Here's details of the dataset. Other people can propose hackathons as well. No, no. Well, topics. Topics for the hackathon. So the hackathon is based on this data set. Yes, there is one hackathon. It is going to be, so this particular hackathon is going to use this particular data set. What happens if there's a second hackathon? There's no second hackathon. What happens if Huawei Dublin convinced them we want to do a hackathon on social media or something? Do we go, yes, fine, of course, welcome. Let's do it. Will it be seen that we sat around the table? Depends on how much money they give you. Okay. It has never happened before, so we do not need to plan for this eventually. But if it did happen, if they give you enough money enough money you do so this is interesting i i think we could have two models that are also justifiable so our community our own community sigman decided to have one hackathon that's based on a real heterogeneous multimedia data and help these topics if anybody else would like hackathon well you have to fund it somehow to win the awards and apply so that we can check whether it's good. I don't see it happening for this year. I guess this may be something for the year after when people see the hackathon happening and say next year we'd like to do something else. I wouldn't care about this stuff this year. Given that this never happened before, I don't expect that people will just run in our doors and say I want to host another hackathon at your venue because the great success of the hackathon that hasn't happened yet inspired me to do that so I don't think this is something we need to worry about and on the off chance that somebody actually comes then we will figure out what to do. Yeah, I agree. Okay, but there's a single hackathon. There's a single hackathon. The SIGM sponsored hackathon around the data set that is being created at this very moment. What? Yes, you're actually on camera, in case you have a notice. But Luca, I have just one request. Because you mentioned also it could be some gaming related topic. Well, it's more of a motivation-y kind of thing. This is more of a motivation-y kind of thing. Yeah, but that's what I told to Maria. Make it playful. Yeah, but why not? I mean, you could... I was thinking more of gamification than of actual video games. video games But if somebody wants to make a video game out of this somehow You could have animated characters from all of us Yeah, sure, if they want to Sounds awesome The enthusiasm No, no problem I would try and set as few constraints as possible, and then just let people run with it. And just essentially set the bounds that this is actually realistic. That we think that this has a reasonable chance of succeeding within the parameters we can enable. But I was just saying that it does not need to be in relation to our data set. No, it should be in relation to the data set somehow. I guess you can make any gamification approach out of it, like for example trying to... I mean, and this could even be health related, right? I mean, you find... or you try to mine patterns of incentives for, I don't know, for moving, for drinking less alcohol, for whatever. And you try to make a game out of that. I guess it should at least be applicable to the dataset and demonstrated based on the dataset. So even if you have a thing and say I'm going to do gamified data augmentation that is theoretically applicable to any video stream, then that is great, but then it is also applicable to this video stream and you're supposed to demonstrate that it is at least among other things applicable to this. Okay I'll write an email summarizing all of that I'll run it by everybody. I wrote some notes. I'll run it by a few people and I will send it to Alan, Alberto and Ramesh who were organizing that meeting. Here's what we came up with. And basically you, I mean there was the talk of data augmentation, you know, data visualization or representation, but you could have kind of also gone on to say health would be one of the things. Health is going to be figured out anyway. We don't have to want health, but there's other ones we can. So just a second, now we've got the first few sets that all solutions, all the work, has to be health related? No. No, no, no, no. There must be a health related. It's an option to make health related. So health is one of the topics of interest. Yes. It is the thing we're going to suggest. Encourage having one. We're going to encourage that this is going to have a health angle. angle if people really said no but I really want to do 40 point cloud caution splattering whatever then let them do 40 point cloud caution splattering. Okay so we get back and we have a data set and a facilitation process to support. And we can incentivize by saying that one of the awards is gonna go to healthcare related topic"

Setting Table,1257,1312, So is that enough
Talking,1312,1471," this we already did this a bunch of times it's possible um they would probably be uh getting angry emails from people but steering committee yes and people on the steering committee yes general chairs and half people at this table who are on the steering committee yes But, yeah, ACM, understanding was ACM we're not going to be happy if we had guaranteed accepted papers in an ACM proceedings I know in theory for for MMM and EBS we don't but we kind of do we have probably never well maybe we have I guess there have been very few rejections, but mostly because people misunderstood the assignment. I mean, the rule is basically any reasonably understandable description of a system that can with some shepherding turn into a readable paper is accepted. Maybe it's time to go back to open up that question again for LSE and go we want this to be an integral part of this conference. That goes back to the steering committee first. So you need to move LSE to ICMR to media? No, I mean for ICMR. Move it into VBS time. It actually makes a difference. Move it into the main proceeding and just say this is a track. That would be very good. But that's what I got pushed back on a few years ago so I can try it again. Maybe also integrate the video data set there for the LSE. Because it fits perfectly to it. To the VPS it would also fit because it's video type. But that's the interactive side. Then really that we focus on the asynchronous stuff for this and the demo is just the synchronous."
Sitting,1471,1473," Semantically, they're still quite different. And I mean to be honest, like if you take, we have a decent share of wedding videos in the dataset. I mean like a group of people being at a wedding is not so different of being here. But we've never done anything with it explicitly, right? So we don't have the wedding subtask. Yeah. This is something we could possibly do for whatever comes after v3c. If there are some directions and say, well, we will inevitably run out of v3c probably within two years or so um so then we might anyway need to design something something else that has new properties for interesting challenges that we foresee for for the future do you see vbs being able to have a track for this dataset where somebody can take part but not take part in the VLC dataset track? That definitely can fit to VBS because we have so many different types already. I mean, how would you split the track? Yeah, I don't know. Do a separate session then? That's anyway something that is increasingly a problem with VVS. We have seen this this year that we had so many different things going on, so many different combinations of data sets and task types that for every single combination there were only very few instances so the amount of data that we actually have, the amount of results, keeps getting smaller and smaller. And it keeps getting increasingly difficult to draw any conclusions from this. So either we cut down on this or we lean into it. Cutting down would mean we keep, we keep the time frame of saying look this is a most, well half day actual challenge, so full day event but there's still some time to everybody getting settled and then we only have the six hours or so to actually do evaluations and there's only so many tasks so we need to scope this time or we say no there's going to be tracks people can sign up for four tracks and then this might be a two-day thing that runs even possibly in parallel to some of the more of the main conference because it just needs more time and then we say explicitly okay this type of thing is on first day in the morning this type of thing is a first day in the afternoon and then people can decide do they want to do all of it do they want to do some of it but then it becomes more. To be honest even having longer expert sessions in the past years has always been logistic trouble. Yeah. With conference starting on Monday not being able to gather rooms on Sunday, so I find it quite difficult. I think an alternative version would be to kind of keep the 3C collection as the main collection and work with one or two satellite collections which could rotate, right? Because now there's the question of how much more do we learn now from, for example, the medical collection? We know it's extremely hard. Do we need to lower? Is this now the new site collection that we would go with? Yeah. So I personally would even prefer using only these three CIPPS in the future, but for question answering tasks and removing the medical dataset maybe again and removing also the MVK again. But I mean this is a good direction to plan the next generation of challenge dataset. Because v3c was primarily designed for DREKV width. So I had quite some discussions with the people behind track width, specifically the ADS track at track width, to see what is it they would want and need from this. And then it was mostly, oh, we have this new thing, we might as well use it for VDS as well."

For me, LSE is... Life looks so challenging. The question is, if we want to research videos there. Then that blurs the difference between LSE and VBS. Well, no, because semantically... This is a POV challenge, right? No, because I guess, and I don't want to... What are you going to? I'm going to go too much into the philosophical discussion of what a life log is. But so far, the life log, the notion of what a life log is has been dictated by what type of data was possible to collect and what type of data was possible to be made available for this sort of thing, given the technology that existed at the time of the recording of this life log. Because this is also a type of life log. It is just something that you would... It's a merging of the two somehow. But his dream would be his life log. My dream is my life log. Yes, exactly. I don't think stationary cameras... No, stationary cameras... They could be. They could be such a thing as a multi-perspective life log if you say, look, person one has a lot of stationary cameras in their house and spends a lot of time in their house. And person two spends a lot of time abroad or all over the place and is having a wearable camera. And person three does not have a camera at all, but essentially narrates their audio log and takes a bunch of pictures. All of these things could be different forms of live logs. Yeah, this is a community live log. So it's still different to what the RSC up until now has done. Yes, but is it because this is precisely the challenge that is the best challenge there could be?"

"The most fitting category for this segment is **Eating**. The primary action depicted is a person seated at a table with food in front of them, engaged in the act of consuming it.",1949,2039," Thank you. feasible task that could actually be implemented. As in, if there was instrumentation to record many, many more things, would we want that, or do we say, no, we want explicitly image sequence thing, because for some reason, this particular thing is the most interesting. In the LSE challenge, we still do have more multimodal data than anybody actually uses, right? So it's still there. You can still use the heart rates and all those things if you want to use it. I mean, so far there have been very few questions, very few tasks where it would actually be useful. So it's a bit of a chicken and egg thing, right? Nobody's processing it. So I would recommend for LSE that we only keep the image-based data set because the entry barrier is much lower for new teams. For as long as that seems sensible right? Yeah and maybe ACM multimedia we use this video-based data set for this asynchronous competitions kind of which not on-site live competitions. At least for the next year or two. And VBS still uses VLC. Yes. V3C. V3C. Whatever. VLC. VLC is something else. It's probably also used. But that still manages to keep... You opened that video. Yes. It manages to keep the separation between the three different things. And that's important unless we just... If we move LSE to use this data set then LSE ultimately becomes that multimedia thing that's mm if you there's danger for VBS as well if you you know into this data set that always there it's it why are you doing this once just do it once so let's keep their focus yes yeah so we have the focus kept on the data sets and in two years time or 18 months time at CASL2, we go back and say, well, how successful is this POV thing been? Yes, but I mean, independently of that, I still foresee a future where several years down the line, LSE might have a very different type of data set. Because at that point, there might be variable cameras that essentially do this type of data,"
Talking,2039,2042," but they are small enough that you can clip it to a shirt and wear it all the time. The first ever lifelong challenge we did at NTCIR was from three people for a month each. We actually did start off with more people, but just it became more of a headache to keep that going. It became two people, one person right so so he started recording the whole time okay don't have your camera yeah so there will be lunch ready in about 10 minutes oh oh good i'm so hungry yeah can i just write up something? Can I try to summarize what I heard? LSE, VBS and ACMMM Grand Challenge slash Hackathon should be having unique signatures. VBS is VBS, let's put it... So let's say with LSE, which is kind of smallest in scope, LSE should be focused on personal life with data, there should be a task that's visual only, to provide, I would say, a low threshold for participation, but nobody prevents people from from using also the other data such as geocordinates and so on and so on. I think it would be interesting to have tasks that actually move. Yes, to put pressure on people who integrate more data. On the other hand, I guess we deliberately sometimes avoiding tasks that are easy to solve with geolocation or things like that. Yeah, but I'm saying, you know, high trade or elevation or something like this. Those things, yes. But I mean, especially for ad hoc kind of queries, it might also be interesting to do more of a, when did I exert myself on yeah kind of things yes which you don't necessarily get from the images yeah right yeah yes things like this so so essentially so essentially there's there's a an aim towards more semantic distinction of the different events. So, let's see... Smell. You checked it out? Yeah, I checked it. It looks really good. Okay. Okay. But with these organs, I have to tell you, it looks like nothing is happening and then all of a sudden... But also from a purely task implementation point of view, I mean we already talked about this yesterday or two days ago, that even the way the tasks are phrased or are conducted have quite some room for design variations. So the motivation behind instant search, known item search, the way I always understood it was a, oh I've seen this thing thing before somewhere at the point in time where I didn't have the chance to actually note anything down or take a picture or anything, and now I want to find it again. And we're trying to simulate this process where you need to inject this memory somehow. Exactly. And, I mean, we're trying to do some experiments how well this memory injection thing actually represents what we're doing, but we haven't seen a lot of variation on how this is done. So I would actually really propose to say okay why don't we have this more conversational style for example and say okay there's there's volunteers that are being shown in the clips and then we can see do they have access to the clip or they're shown the clip beforehand and then they actually have to remember and then they're just there and say okay I'm going to describe this to you and you can shout questions at me and then maybe we need to have a not everybody shouting at once kind of mechanism but this would essentially be a new variant of of kiss yeah which is less predictable but is is inherently more interactive because it is actually back and forth between an intelligent agent, as in a person describing what they remember, and all the people searching for it. So we should also probably consider that now, and that you have an IR, maybe that's like for them, people are increasingly kind of playing with LLM, taking that role. So instead of having these volunteers, you could actually take a very large model, show it the content alongside the ground truth and actually make it act as some sort of oracle. Well, you don't need the content alongside the ground. I mean, if you describe a ground truth, I think that there's two things here one thing is you show it the content but then you rely on the capabilities of that model doing the visual interpretation which is a bit dangerous i think what i could imagine is you try to write it down and then you purely rely on the text of looking up things in that particular text which for which i think the lm would be much more reliable i'm not saying there is one way to do that but people are playing what can they do actually given that this is going to be a one-shot interactive thing anyway i'm much more inclined to actually have a person there yeah i mean why not have a person and have an llm in parallel parallel just to benchmark that one? Yes, well we can we can also do that But to have the I'm gonna ask you something strange because this is how my system happens to work And the LLM may or may not have ever thought of that. Yeah, but also this is this is then a thing of the person. They say, oh, well, let me think. Maybe I remember or maybe I don't know. We had this thing, for example, well, if I know that my OCR is very good, then I'm going to pay attention to any little piece of text that's on the screen, even though you probably would never have paid attention to this if you just had seen it in the wild. Whereas probably if you actually just show it to a person without priming them to oh yeah by the way I have a very good OCR, they're just not gonna know. Or maybe they do or maybe they misremember. But then you have the actual... So you know who would know it? If you provide your paper, like let's say VBS submission to a large model, it could pick up what the components are, probably even better than a... No, but the large model does either know or it doesn't, right? So it's not going to pay attention differently based on the papers you primeed. It either has the visual capabilities of extracting this information or it doesn't. And probably something OCR-y is way lower in the semantic hierarchy, so it will have a much easier job of saying, was there any text on the screen? Yes, there's all the text I remember seeing on the screen. What's this shot in southern Europe? And they said, well, how would I know? We had a summer intern working on video to text this summer and exactly this point that you mentioned of named places. This is something where you would compare different models and they differ a lot. Some never fix any location, others always give you a location. Sometimes it's right, sometimes it's wrong. So these things you really see like, did they have some geo-referenced data in the training or how much of that did they have? But yeah, but I mean, I like this idea and I think it's really, I like it also because it highlights the importance of doing that in the interactive session. This is not something you can do asynchronously. Whether you do it with people or with models, the answers will never be the same. So you have to do that in the interactive challenge. So it would be reasonably easy to implement. the only thing that we would need to make sure is that there is some sort of audio video recording of the event so we actually have a record of this dialogue that happened because otherwise we just put the same thing into the race and just as a hint you leave it empty yeah and you have a person there who is instructed to answer these questions and the system still will know what the ground truth is and will judge accordingly. Yeah I guess the question is also like how to design it maybe it could be like a panel of people there who do this answering just to balance memory capabilities of people. Some people being better at visual things, some people better at conceptual things. So maybe having like a panel of three people there and together they answer. And they also have to agree what they answer. What is the practical scenario and practical, let's say, research question? Something like this is much closer to the scenario of you having the memory and needing to investigate a system. Or even imagine way back when we had archivists for this sort of thing, that would be the only ones having access to the collection. You walking up to the archivist and say, look, I need this type of footage from way back when I know I've seen it. And then it's a, okay, let me help you try to find it. What was it about and what you do is you you equalize conditions because we have these cases where we thought about showing people video clips before and then have their memory let it find it right but then it depends on the memory capabilities visual memory capabilities of the individual participant here you make level this for all you have have the same. Yeah and I mean what we could even do is have give the person some visualizer thing so they can draw things on the whiteboard on a flip chart and say oh yeah it was sort of like this and there was this person over there. Because we also have the differences, especially for the textual tasks, there's on the one hand the cultural and the knowledge context. So if you say a particular thing, it invokes a different image in my mind than it might invoke in somebody else's. There's also different levels of how visual people are actually thinking. So how much of an image this actually invokes. And probably all of this somehow feeds into the process, and it's very hard to quantify how and to what degree. And we've so far never even attempted this, because it is, how would you even design this? But if you have another person serving as a proxy for this, it at least... þetta er það sem þú þátt þetta. Það er það sem þú þátt þetta.

So let's say with LSE, which is kind of smallest in scope, LSE should be focused on personal life with data, there should be a task that's visual only, to provide, I would say, a low threshold for participation, but nobody prevents people from from using also the other data such as geocordinates and so on and so on. I think it would be interesting to have tasks that actually move. Yes, to put pressure on people who integrate more data. On the other hand, I guess we deliberately sometimes avoiding tasks that are easy to solve with geolocation or things like that. Yeah, but I'm saying, you know, high trade or elevation or something like this. Those things, yes. But I mean, especially for ad hoc kind of queries, it might also be interesting to do more of a, when did I exert myself on yeah kind of things yes which you don't necessarily get from the images yeah right yeah yes things like this so so essentially so essentially there's there's a an aim towards more semantic distinction of the different events. So, let's see... Smell. You checked it out? Yeah, I checked it. It looks really good. Okay. Okay. But with these organs, I have to tell you, it looks like nothing is happening and then all of a sudden... But also from a purely task implementation point of view, I mean we already talked about this yesterday or two days ago, that even the way the tasks are phrased or are conducted have quite some room for design variations. So the motivation behind instant search, known item search, the way I always understood it was a, oh I've seen this thing thing before somewhere at the point in time where I didn't have the chance to actually note anything down or take a picture or anything, and now I want to find it again. And we're trying to simulate this process where you need to inject this memory somehow. Exactly. And, I mean, we're trying to do some experiments how well this memory injection thing actually represents what we're doing, but we haven't seen a lot of variation on how this is done. So I would actually really propose to say okay why don't we have this more conversational style for example and say okay there's there's volunteers that are being shown in the clips and then we can see do they have access to the clip or they're shown the clip beforehand and then they actually have to remember and then they're just there and say okay I'm going to describe this to you and you can shout questions at me and then maybe we need to have a not everybody shouting at once kind of mechanism but this would essentially be a new variant of of kiss yeah which is less predictable but is is inherently more interactive because it is actually back and forth between an intelligent agent, as in a person describing what they remember, and all the people searching for it. So we should also probably consider that now, and that you have an IR, maybe that's like for them, people are increasingly kind of playing with LLM, taking that role. So instead of having these volunteers, you could actually take a very large model, show it the content alongside the ground truth and actually make it act as some sort of oracle. Well, you don't need the content alongside the ground. I mean, if you describe a ground truth, I think that there's two things here one thing is you show it the content but then you rely on the capabilities of that model doing the visual interpretation which is a bit dangerous i think what i could imagine is you try to write it down and then you purely rely on the text of looking up things in that particular text which for which i think the lm would be much more reliable i'm not saying there is one way to do that but people are playing what can they do actually given that this is going to be a one-shot interactive thing anyway i'm much more inclined to actually have a person there yeah i mean why not have a person and have an llm in parallel parallel just to benchmark that one? Yes, well we can we can also do that But to have the I'm gonna ask you something strange because this is how my system happens to work And the LLM may or may not have ever thought of that. Yeah, but also this is this is then a thing of the person. They say, oh, well, let me think. Maybe I remember or maybe I don't know. We had this thing, for example, well, if I know that my OCR is very good, then I'm going to pay attention to any little piece of text that's on the screen, even though you probably would never have paid attention to this if you just had seen it in the wild. Whereas probably if you actually just show it to a person without priming them to oh yeah by the way I have a very good OCR, they're just not gonna know. Or maybe they do or maybe they misremember. But then you have the actual... So you know who would know it? If you provide your paper, like let's say VBS submission to a large model, it could pick up what the components are, probably even better than a... No, but the large model does either know or it doesn't, right? So it's not going to pay attention differently based on the papers you primeed. It either has the visual capabilities of extracting this information or it doesn't. And probably something OCR-y is way lower in the semantic hierarchy, so it will have a much easier job of saying, was there any text on the screen? Yes, there's all the text I remember seeing on the screen. What's this shot in southern Europe? And they said, well, how would I know? We had a summer intern working on video to text this summer and exactly this point that you mentioned of named places. This is something where you would compare different models and they differ a lot. Some never fix any location, others always give you a location. Sometimes it's right, sometimes it's wrong. So these things you really see like, did they have some geo-referenced data in the training or how much of that did they have? But yeah, but I mean, I like this idea and I think it's really, I like it also because it highlights the importance of doing that in the interactive session. This is not something you can do asynchronously. Whether you do it with people or with models, the answers will never be the same. So you have to do that in the interactive challenge. So it would be reasonably easy to implement. the only thing that we would need to make sure is that there is some sort of audio video recording of the event so we actually have a record of this dialogue that happened because otherwise we just put the same thing into the race and just as a hint you leave it empty yeah and you have a person there who is instructed to answer these questions and the system still will know what the ground truth is and will judge accordingly. Yeah I guess the question is also like how to design it maybe it could be like a panel of people there who do this answering just to balance memory capabilities of people. Some people being better at visual things, some people better at conceptual things. So maybe having like a panel of three people there and together they answer. And they also have to agree what they answer. What is the practical scenario and practical, let's say, research question? Something like this is much closer to the scenario of you having the memory and needing to investigate a system. Or even imagine way back when we had archivists for this sort of thing, that would be the only ones having access to the collection. You walking up to the archivist and say, look, I need this type of footage from way back when I know I've seen it. And then it's a, okay, let me help you try to find it. What was it about and what you do is you you equalize conditions because we have these cases where we thought about showing people video clips before and then have their memory let it find it right but then it depends on the memory capabilities visual memory capabilities of the individual participant here you make level this for all you have have the same. Yeah and I mean what we could even do is have give the person some visualizer thing so they can draw things on the whiteboard on a flip chart and say oh yeah it was sort of like this and there was this person over there. Because we also have the differences, especially for the textual tasks, there's on the one hand the cultural and the knowledge context. So if you say a particular thing, it invokes a different image in my mind than it might invoke in somebody else's. There's also different levels of how visual people are actually thinking. So how much of an image this actually invokes. And probably all of this somehow feeds into the process, and it's very hard to quantify how and to what degree. And we've so far never even attempted this, because it is, how would you even design this? But if you have another person serving as a proxy for this, it at least... þetta er það sem þú þátt þetta. Það er það sem þú þátt þetta.

Eating,3025,3262," want whereas if I say okay now I really need to know if it's a landscape or a portrait and then the next thing you say oh yeah by the way there's a tree in the background so can't we make it like this so this is good what you say so teams are working on you know motivational let's say search task and then after maybe a minute or two we allow them or maybe literally kind of once or twice during that time period to answer some questions you know there are gonna be some questions there popping up from different teams they can ask maybe one question each then it gets a game theory aspect because the questions are answered all at the same time there's a time limit the answer to the questions are going to be available to everybody so then you will since you want to win this you will try and ask questions that help you most while revealing as little useful information to everybody else if you if you can do that so the questions are going to be very narrow to the capabilities of your thing which may or may not be a good representation of það. Það er það að hluti það að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er að það er svona einhverjum ílægðan í hlutum.

Það meður meðan það spot you create the next step but or you might have multiple different alternatives for the next step I now decide what's gonna be the next thing that I give out okay I may or may not answer your question or yeah so I mean so what we what we could do is rather than everybody shouting the questions we have we could use one of these audience participation tools where people can submit and vote on questions but then it's it again has the interaction burden that I actually need to type in my question I need to look at all the questions that are already there. You would type in your question you don't know any other questions. So without trivia we are working on a paper for CIGAR. We are now working on a paper for CIGAR so please don't use this idea, but I think many other people use the same. So there is this interesting aspect of diffing, you know, like you have one set, you have another set, and okay, that's what I cannot tell you. So just translating it without going into that one, it's not related to this story when you get those results basically you would like to know how far is it from the ground truth truth is sort of this mental image of what you just described that's like information oracle meaning you and the system knows that oracle beforehand because you probably answered it. So now there are these tools and they're getting increasingly good, you know, like, diffing, kind of asking, hey, what is there and not in this set or from this set, which one's good.

I see you have too. You have people more in tuned with the spirit of the task. Yeah, fair enough. So are we writing up something about it, about diffing or not? I think this is a great thing and we should try to have this implemented in 26. Yes. Because that would also require some actual technical actual technical work to be done whereas the other thing is really some organizational work by that time if it's 26 we are already solving some of these things with Kongi like diffing also negative or what if everything is relevant so this particular one that interests us a lot because in most cases when you start talking about these conversations all things are irrelevant and you basically have to kind of somehow deal... it's none of this. It's none of this. So what do you tell to a team that's submitting something that... I mean it's also doing this for video is probably the... Thank you. Doing this is the most difficult modality of all the standard modalities we currently deal with.

"This image most likely depicts **Cooking**. Here's why:

*   **Headlamp:** The man is wearing a headlamp, which is commonly used by people when working in dimly lit areas, such as kitchens or during activities that require focused light, like cooking.
*   **Towel:** He has a towel draped over his shoulder, which is a common accessory for cooks to wipe their hands or surfaces.
*   **Background:** The background appears to be an indoor setting, possibly a kitchen or dining area, with a window showing an outdoor scene. The presence of what looks like a stove or cooking equipment in the foreground (though not clearly visible) would further support this.

While other categories might involve a person in an indoor setting, the combination of the headlamp and the towel strongly suggests a cooking-related activity.",1949,1950, what did the christmas tree say to the decoration don't know.

Here's why:

* **Presence of a dining table:** The central focus is a table set for a meal.
* **Items on the table:** There are plates, glasses, napkins, and cutlery arranged on the table, indicating preparation for dining.
* **Actions of the individuals:** Some individuals are interacting with items on the table, such as the woman placing something down, suggesting the process of setting or arranging the table. 
* **Contextual clues:** The overall scene suggests a gathering where a meal is about to take place or is in the early stages of preparation.",733,734," Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.

"The image shows a man in a room with a dining table and chairs. There is also a Christmas tree, suggesting it might be the holiday season. The man is wearing a headlamp and appears to be looking at something off-camera. The overall scene does not clearly indicate any of the specific activities listed in the categories.

However, if we consider the general context of a home environment and the presence of a dining table, it's possible that the man is engaged in a leisure activity or preparing for a meal. Without more information or a clearer view of his actions, it's difficult to definitively classify the segment.

If I am forced to choose from the given categories, and assuming this is a candid shot of someone at home, **Leisure Activities** might be the most appropriate, albeit very general, category. This is because many of the other categories are too specific and not supported by the visual evidence.",1804,1806," I'm breaking to the beach now. It isn't like you do I'm here. Look there.
