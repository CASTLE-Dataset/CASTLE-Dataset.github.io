Meeting,700,1116," Yes, so hopefully the portrait... Why are we wearing the same shirt man? When you become elderly person you buy this brand and then soon it becomes the same color. I brought my ICMR one because I thought more people would have it. We get confusable on camera. I didn't think that far. So actually we think that this data set might be usable for the LiveLog search engine but also maybe for the video browser showdown. So I will give a very short introduction what it actually is. So what is it? It's a live evaluation platform for interactive video search which really performs large scale video content retrieval and we have different types of queries I will give some examples and we have a competitive setup because we have not only a large data set but we have also a lot of participants and yeah it's going for several hours it's also an entertaining event because it's connected to the webcam reception at the MMM conference every year. And so this is how it looks like. It started in 2012 in Klagenfurt and then we went every year to different places at the MMM conference. And what you can see here on the right, this is the last iteration in 2024. and next year we will continue this in january with 16 teams actually and here we can also see that a lot of different teams from all around the world have participated in this competition there are some very strong teams one of them of course is from the University of Passau, one from Charles University in Prague and another one from PISA. Yeah, and a few more of course, there are so many teams that I cannot mention them all. And the query types, we have known item search, where you know what you are looking for visually, So, texturally. The second one, so that would be a visual example. And it seems to find this as fast as possible. And I only see this small clip. And the texture one would be a description like a girl and a man run up a small hill. There is a flagpole with a Canadian flag on top. There are white green benches, a lamp post and stairs up the hill. The flagpole is on top of a stone structure with a cannon. I think this was a very challenging task actually. I could hardly imagine how it looked like. Yeah, and that would be the. Right so we were going to see the flagpole. Okay then we have official question answering. Somehow I did not have enough time. But we have the question answering like this. How many nights do we see passing in the video until this segment? I think this is very interesting because you also need the video playback functionality and quickly go over the video. And of course you need to understand that the darkness outside could be an indication of how many nights you see in the video. And we have um... All right, that's not way too much music. Not too much music. Okay. You got maybe... Mute us? Perfect. If the license of the data set is okay, then this okay this should be this should be Well, well it it should be yeah, it should be yeah, it should be all of these videos are Creative Commons licensed Yeah, but Where yes Some some of these people who made these videos are not entirely versed in the intricacies of licensing. So there may be... They're all lawyers? They're probably... Okay, yeah. Anyway, so this is from B3C. Should be fine. And then we start with video search where we need to find as many as possible items for a specific topic and i don't have any example for that but luca mentioned the data set here we can see the different data sets that were used over the years we started with only 30 videos 38 hours we went on to 100 hours and then ended up last year with 23,300 hours from the V3C1 and V3C2 data set."
Meeting,1116,1536," in one month roughly so we may have in 2026 a lifelong challenge as part of this right right right exactly so that would be another part for the vps we are looking into these and for 400 hours 500 600 hours of content. Right? There it was. That high overlap. 400, though. Not quite as much. It takes cameras as well, right? Yeah, sure, but it's only about, well, we'll go into the numbers in a bit. So that would be a very nice challenge as well. And yeah, I think finally to conclude my part of the presentation, I think what we saw at the VPS is that currently all systems use state-of-the-art technologies like FLIP and FLIP and so on. But also there is some consistency within teams that the same team with different users perform similarly, which is good, I think. And the user interface interface is very important I think this is also a very unique aspect of the VPS it's not only let's say the system behind but a lot is by the user interface and how you provide interaction. Actually nice to have kept the video browser term. Yes, exactly. I think it's quite important. Exactly. Right, so that's it, so thank you very much. May I just short advertisement break in this point? If you think VDS is a cool thing to do and you haven't volunteered any judges from your team for 2025, please let me know. Lyn's going. Volunteer! You don't need to be there actually, judges can be remote as well. But if you're there, you know better. You're going too, yes. You can do it remotely, but what time in total?

This gives us about eight or so hours depending on what's actually going on, of recording capacity per camera per day. These recordings are not necessarily continuous. You can interrupt them at any time. Whenever you're doing something that you may not want to be on the record, you can interrupt this at any time. Again, important, just pause the recording. Do not turn off the camera, because if you turn off the camera, it goes out of sync and all the timing issues, and it might also then complain about starting up. It has some not enough power issues, because it's not actually powered from the internal battery it is powered yes yes try try not to touch the touchscreen because it is very swipey right you might accidentally change the mode or something so try to only use the top button also it is blinking whenever it is recording so I can now see when I look at all of you that all of your cameras are actually blinking. So all of you will recording what I'm telling you. If you happen to see somebody walking around and the camera is not blinking, do let them know because that might not be intentional. Do you also have a feeling of this Strange Days cyberpunk movie? Do you remember that one 20 some years ago? I don't know. Nice car. We all look reasonable though, right? I mean, it could be worse. So, in order to facilitate this long-form recording, you are also all wearing pouches or other types of batteries. So this is a 20-amp hour battery. It has plenty of capacity to run this camera until the SD card is full. We will recharge these every night as well. So every night, data is copied off.

On top of that, there will be some non-streaming data, so we have some other photographic cameras that we can take some pictures with, and some other sensors just to record some bits and pieces that can be used as augmentation. And then of course all the things that we will be able to extract from this data and especially from the aggregate across different views.

But we have so much data now and even overlap in streams. I think this is going to be super kind of interesting for self-supervised folks. Right, right. Yes, and I mean, this is only the first step, right? Because this is all off-the-shelf hardware. So what is also an intent of this workshop here is to think beyond what we're currently able to do. What's the next workshop? And see if we had infinite budget and infinite time, what would we want to do? And then essentially boil this down to given that we are presumably not going to have infinite budget and infinite time, what will we be actually able to do if we plan for doing this again in a year or in two years? So I think maybe even more ambitious goal would be in order because you remember the first session at AC Multimedia, they were talking about future and about multimedia agents and so on. I think maybe we have to even think, hey, not in terms of how do we want, actually that's what they would like us to think about. How would we like the entire field to start doing with regard to one of these lines that's what the hackathon conversation at AC Multimedia was about that was a particular invitation workshop where the hackathon came out of that was all about the future challenges for the community not only this workshop but kind of in general yes exactly but all of this hinges on actually having concrete material to work with. And this is gonna be one set of data, right? And this has properties that will be unique among the available data sets, because this is not gonna be the first POV activity data set. There are a handful of these, and they have been studied quite a bit. But all of these have the limitation that they're either longer form activities in a very confined environment, or that they're very diverse activities in diverse environments that are completely disjointed. So you just have a few recordings of a few minutes, some person doing something, and then this is gone. And you never know what happened before or what happened after. Usually, this is also happening in public. Therefore, it's heavily anonymized. You are never having people have to move. Look, it's taking longer. There's going to be coffee. We will hopefully not run out of coffee. But then again, we might also be able to do things like, when did I have coffee predict this solely based on my heart rate, right? Things like that. It's got to be epic. Long ago. Yeah, possibly, right? So, again, the thing is, this will have overlap with types of data that exist. So we will also be able to take inspirations on the kind of tasks that people have been doing with other types of data that has the overlapping aspects. But this is going to have aspects that do not exist because we have many people in the same environment interacting with each other and with the environment. And we have the first person view of all of these people. So this is something that is unique, that is not currently possible to do with any of these data sets that exist. So this will allow us to do new things. the whole whole point of this and also of day one today is to start the discussion on what all these things that we could leverage this for might be."

Meeting,162,163, If we clap at the same time?
Watching TV,163,173, If we clap at the same time?
Meeting,173,411," Yeah. I mean, there's so many interesting things. The house itself is not going to change, so we can even do a 3D reconstruction of the whole thing and then compute the position of the camera at any point in time. The house is going to change, like you moved the chair over there. Yes, but, I mean, at least there's some anchors that are not going to change. Let's hear about that. This is a really interesting thing. This is what you have in industrial environments. You have things changing around in a digital system. Yes, absolutely. And I mean, what you alluded to, there will be some things happening behind the scenes."
Meeting,411,564," But this is already leading us into the homework that people should have to do, right? So the agenda item for tomorrow is essentially to discuss and present and discuss all the things you came up with for both the ideas for the challenge and the ideas for the hackathon. So I would ask everybody to, throughout the day, think about this. If you want to discuss this with other people, feel free to discuss this with other people. If you want to write things down, feel free to write things down. If you want to prepare some slides, feel free to prepare some slides. If you don't want to prepare some slides, feel free to just do this without. All of this is perfectly fine. But ideally, we have a bunch of stuff ready for tomorrow that we can then have a discussion about, and that will guide us towards more concrete instantiations. I mean, it kind of goes hand in hand, right? Because some of this will involve doing data augmentation. Some of this data augmentation we will do beforehand. Some of this data augmentation might also be an interesting task for a hackathon that we can put out there as suggested topics. And then, of course, people can come up with their own topics. All of this to be determined, right? So this is very much a, we will try and make this as broad and as interesting as we can make it. So the more ideas, the merrier. So what has to come out of this is a grand challenge"

"Based on the image provided, the most fitting classification is **Cooking**.

Here's why:

*   **Kitchen Environment:** The image clearly depicts a kitchen counter with various food items, a kettle, and a stovetop.

I'll have to do some mailing later, but I can get to them after lunch. So, Luca, what is the program for today? There's no hard and fixed program anymore for today.

Is this the most bowl-y bowl that we have? I'm afraid this is the most bowl. Okay, then this is... Okay, this we'll have to do. Can I take a nap? Is this your activity?

"The most fitting category for this segment is **Leisure Activities**. 

Here's why:
* **Group Activity:** The people appear to be engaged in a shared activity, bringing in boxes, which suggests a social gathering or event.
* **Informal Setting:** The kitchen environment and the casual attire of the individuals point towards a non-work or formal occasion.
* **Potential for Fun:** While the exact nature of the boxes isn't clear, bringing in new items and being together as a group often falls under the umbrella of leisure and enjoyment.",1677,1687," Thank you. red peppers.

"The image shows a person in a kitchen, and the context suggests they might be preparing something to eat or drink, or perhaps cleaning up. However, without more information, it's difficult to definitively classify the activity. The blurred nature of the image and the lack of clear visual cues make it challenging to pinpoint a specific action.

The categories provided are quite specific, and none of them perfectly capture a general sense of being in a kitchen without a clear action. If forced to choose from the given options, and assuming a common kitchen activity, the most plausible, albeit speculative, options might be related to food or drink preparation.

However, since I am required to provide a definitive classification, and the image does not provide enough information to confidently select any of the specific actions, I cannot confidently classify this segment.

If this were a more general image classification task, I would classify it as ""Kitchen"" or ""Indoors"".

"The provided images show a person wearing a head-mounted camera, possibly a GoPro, and adjusting it with their hands. The setting appears to be indoors, with a mirror and some decorative items in the background.

Based on the visual evidence, the most fitting classification for this segment is **Leisure Activities**.

Here's why:

*   **Head-mounted camera:** This type of camera is often used for activities like vlogging, capturing experiences, or documenting hobbies, all of which fall under leisure.
*   **Indoor setting with personal items:** The environment suggests a personal or recreational space rather than a professional or chore-related one.

*   **Kitchen Setting:** The background shows kitchen cabinets and appliances, strongly suggesting a kitchen environment where cooking typically takes place.
*   **Tools for Preparation:** A cutting board is visible, which is a key tool used in food preparation and cooking.
*   **Oily Substance:** A bottle of cooking oil is prominently displayed, further reinforcing the idea of cooking.
*   **Multiple People:** While the activity of everyone isn't entirely clear, the presence of multiple people in a kitchen setting with ingredients often indicates a shared activity like cooking or preparing a meal.

"The most fitting category for this image is **Cooking**. Here's why:

* **Visible Ingredients:** The table is laden with fresh produce like pineapples, oranges, bananas, apples, limes, and ginger. This strongly suggests preparation of food.
* **Kitchen Setting:** The image is clearly set in a kitchen, a primary location for cooking.
* **Utensils and Equipment:** There's a large pot or pan visible, along with what appears to be a cutting board and a grater, all common cooking tools.
* **Food Preparation Elements:** The presence of a bottle of oil and what looks like some pre-mixed ingredients (in the bowl at the bottom) further points towards the act of cooking.

While other activities might occur in a kitchen, the overwhelming presence of raw ingredients and cooking implements makes ""Cooking"" the most accurate classification.",3393,3434," No, it's okay.

No, no, no. If I don't claim to be better than you, I don't have to show my card. So you would have won, you just choose to... I could, you know what, I could to like... To just mess with you. Yes.

No, no, no. If I don't claim to be better than you, I don't have to show my card. So you would have won, you just choose to... I could, you know what, I could to like... To just mess with you. Yes.

First a round of betting, then the river is revealed, the three. Then another round of betting, the turn.

Or, I don't know. We did some research before, they have a different guy do a lot of things about the floppy head. I don't know, but it might actually be that it's all the same kind of playing. This is all different. This is fine. Oh, okay, so I've got to raise to ten. Well, no, it's her, then it's your turn. So you have to go first.

I will contact their help and return this to me I don't want these services this is ridiculous you are crazy can we can figure out how we can do this with my domain yes and and we need to be just discussed we need to get the workshop proposal see tutorial workshops yes soon yes so let's take a sit down today at some stage of the afternoon and just make a plan for this. We can do it on camera. It's okay. We can also do it not on camera because at some point you're going to run out of recording capacity anyway. I have less than four hours of storage left today. That's what you're hoping for. You're done. No, it I've been through for eight hours no it's fine I mean I've been taking a break and just doing some email before but so that was not on camera but so far two brief breaks to go to the bathroom check some email it shows how much storage is left? It shows you on the back of the screen, so you have to take it off. I don't bother with that. I can move mine off. Just leave it there. So if you just touch the screen, it shows you on the top. Three hours and 54 minutes. Yes, that's the estimated storage capacity. It's plus minus a a bit right because it's so we made a mistake by two five six days probably a year and a half ago yes should have just bought another one terabyte ones and the style had not had to do well the half terabyte ones are enough but um but clifton wouldn't have that probably not and Amazon wouldn't get this here in time yes so not in time okay let's do the workshop tutorials today we have been and Graham at the workshops chairs on somebody else let's get to them. So, so Graham actually agreed. He agreed to do it. Okay. Yes. Okay. Actually did in my office. I had a witness, but he's on holiday this week. I will be meeting bin next week. Well hammer hammer the importance of getting these things out to Bin."

*   **Utensils and Equipment:** Various kitchen utensils, cutting boards, and possibly appliances are visible, supporting the idea of cooking in progress.
