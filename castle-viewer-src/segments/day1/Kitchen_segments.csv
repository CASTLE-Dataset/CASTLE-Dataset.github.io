Who ate all the flour at the private session? If I suddenly have the chopped and sprinkled, this is much more, um, rationalizable than, in some ways, it's lower. In fact, I'm having a great time. Chopped right. Oh, yes. It's good. This is going to be a killer for this meal. It has to be captured as well. We've got to work on that. It'll take two rows of strength. I've been here. As a winner, it's up to two and a half to four rows. If you have the best string, you can get that on the orange string. If you have only two, I can make a slide ring about as well. You can definitely put one. Okay, so we'll do it. And we're going to get very tight around here.. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Whose car? My car. No I'm not.

Remember, there is a regulation imposed on a......a horeca set, as we call it, hortals, restaurants and horecapes, and they really complain about supermarkets. So, we recorded the......because of closing. So they were really against these discounts on alcohol in a wine store. So these three discounts were cancelled. 50% they were reduced to 25% in the maximum. And the rule was like also to tell you that you can't go back. But the point is, we don't want them taking our business. Probably because the capsaicin not allowed to serve. They said add them to the supermarket. Right. Is that more logical?

Washing dishes,1438,1474," That was crazy. Oh my god! This is awesome, isn't it? Thank you, we're happy to be here. Thank you, Werner and Stefan. Now that we solved the when question, I think we also solved the what question. Yeah, I'm fine. That was scheduled for Monday, September 1st. Yeah, it was the lunch before the snack factory, so I think maybe if we had something lighter for that day, it would have been better. The thing that needs to be considered in advance, dishes that take a long time to prepare should probably not be scheduled for lunch. I think they take a long time could take one time. Okay. Can you stop now? Can you stop now? But then again, a lasagna could be a lunch because you couldn't even do it the day before and then just put it on the table. That might actually be a lunch. Basically, I have to put it in the oven before the work comes. Okay. Okay, great. But then lasagna should be lunched on Thursday, so you can prepare it tomorrow afternoon and then it is ready and then we can just put it in the oven. Can I have the cheese please? Do we have nothing else? We have a different deal, it's a pseudo deal. How do you know there's nothing of the veal meal? The veal meals? The veal meal? Why would we not do that? The map might show us. There's two people with eyes on the beef now. We have to make sure we have enough beef. How many kilograms of beef do you need? However many specified... How many of them eat beef and eat veal? Yes. The young beef. It's a 1.5 year old cow. It's specifically young beef. What type of beef? Silver or veal. Do you mean to make it something that we can actually appreciate? Something that's not killed with this? I asked him about veal and he said, well, they eat it. I'm thinking of some other place. I asked him about the bill, and he said, what a deal. Not that it's watching. What a deal. At least that's service. Yes, he will buy the bill. Did we say that we had too much cheese yeah okay so then tomorrow what's the plan for food let's just get this figured out because we have too many messages tomorrow they are going to do a lot of chatting different dishes this guy is going do a baguette for Thursday, but for tomorrow? Yeah. For lunch. I can do something on our top. I can do, tomorrow I can do whatever. Wednesday, Wednesday. That's the one we ate, I want Indian tomorrow. Wednesday or Indian. So, Indian. So, is that a lunch or a dinner? It's Indian. So we have two recipes, so daum and aloo gobi. That sounds like a dinner. But beef stew is dinner. Daum is just beef. You can take it anytime. We can do a light breakfast tomorrow. It's not very heavy. We can dip it in our sauce for breakfast tomorrow. Yeah. We don't necessarily do this part. We are chopping ourselves up. I don't know if you can... Oh, please stop. Oh, he actually can. He can. Because we put the chocolate in afterwards. Yeah. I can put chocolate in and it fills in. So, I don't know if it's the way you like. But do you need to make the dough from scratch? Oh, yeah. Oh, okay. Don't talk to me in three minutes. What do you need for the dough? They are already filled, this chap? I'm not sure that we're getting over there. I'll make it to the middle, because I don't know if you need an American powder. I'm not sure we have that. OK. Let me try this again. By the way, do you order the puff pastry? Puff pastry? No, we ordered the puff pastry. We just magically give you the list. No, we have puff pastry, but a snack that we thought would be useful. Because there's a cheese inside. Ah, yes. Pizza rolls or something. Yeah, or chocolate inside, like chocolate rolls. I like a dessert. Okay. I'm going to have a drink. Okay. I'm going to have a drink. Okay. I'm going to have a drink. Okay. I'm going to have a drink. Okay. I'm going to have a drink. Okay. I'm going to have a drink. Okay. I'm going to have a drink. dessert. Okay. Oh, we have a table. Thank you. That was very good. I know. I can't think of anything from today. You never need this. Isn't it a waste? You never need dessert. That's not the point of dessert. Okay, so tomorrow we have the deviant and the mullet please. Yeah, on Thursday we have pasta and something. That's that one, right? Lasagna. That's toast then. I'm Kostein night. Okay, curry and pasta and lasagne. On Friday we only eat lunch not too late. So why don't you want the the turkey? Oh, the mizrushki. Yes, mizrushki, exactly. For which we specifically wasted the 6 kilograms of potatoes. Which we have to... Not to fry, but to cook. No, no, I guess what we want to do is... We will use the potato stews for my curry. We actually use a lot of potatoes. This is exactly what I meant, so I'm adding recipes to a list, but then not adding more days, right? How about seven days? There's only so many meals. Well, perhaps a little Sunday, we can add one part. The chicken with skin. Yeah. Okay, why don't we replace the meat stew with the chicken hot pot? Hi. Okay. Lucky is all the veal for... Okay, when do you want that? Simulation veal. I'm going to have some carrots here on Friday. Which one do you want? It's probably more over evening or anything thing. Okay. Why don't we do the chicken on Friday for lunch? Yeah. And what about tomorrow? Tomorrow we're doing... But then, if we already have a bunch of stuff for recipes, then why don't we prioritize the recipes for which we already have the stuff, rather than going shopping for more recipes that we don't actually have slots for in the schedule? OK, so let's take it back to. If you're not doing beef steak, what are you doing with chicken? Sous-l'Oviel. You don't have to go all that. When is that? Sous-l'Oviel is gone. That's going to be Thursday. Or Wednesday. OK, we're going to have to decide, though. I can't just say, wait, we can't just say, wait, we can't just say, wait, we can't just say, wait, we can't just say, wait, we can't just say, wait, we can't just say, wait, we can't just say, wait, we can't just say, wait, we can't just say, wait, we can't just say, wait, we can't just say, wait, we can't just say, wait, we can't just say, wait, we can't Okay, this is infuriating. list.

So maybe for Friday, if you ask me, because, uh, why don't we have lunch because we leave at 5 past... We can't give it to another slot, otherwise we'll never get you lunch. It's an eating competition. Last Sunday I bought lunch, you didn't? Thursday, yeah. Friday. Friday, Friday? Yeah, last Sunday. Last Sunday, Friday. Someday it's not Friday. It's Friday. It's Friday?

We can find somewhere nice to eat something on the way back. How is Dean going home? By taxi. From here to the Louvre? No, thanks. If he helps out in the weather, it might be nice to see you. I think we should do that, yes. Don't worry about the TV. You guys don't see the TV. No, but we can take the TV. Probably not. It is. Faria, not at all. You know, we're just... I like Cape Fowl.

Wednesday AM, do we want sausage and bacon and pudding or do we want croissant tomorrow? Croissant. I'm not sure that we have stuff for that. We did. We have stuff for that. But not for me from scratch. We're gonna for that. We don't have the. No, not for me, from scratch. We're going to pack it. We just put it in the chocolate folder, or we'll put it in the other. No, no, no, we have actually. Yes, that. It's required. It's not from scratch for me. So you will make six croissants in 20 seconds. I have to have another second. Oh, but that's like pre-made or something. something. Yes, almost. You have to fold them. I know, but that's the thing. The Thursday breakfast. It's like any attempt. I don't have to cast a temper. Thursday is going to be like, ooh, it's very good. It's like some curry. Some hikerswun. Pryd. Pryd. Ystod diwrnod. Ystod diwrnod. Ystod diwrnod. Ystod diwrnod. Ystod diwrnod. Ystod diwrnod.

Does that exist? Yeah, okay, that makes more sense. V40? No. Kaho? I... You said you wanted to... No, wait, wait, wait, wait. Kalu, Luka, Tien, no? I have faced one more person. Well, if you don't mind a TV on your lap. I don't have a TV on my lap. I just want to be like in the back. Or an e- eating. Yes. Go ahead. Go ahead. Maybe we're going to dump stuff anyway, how you can put the TV in the back of it. Yeah. I've got to drive an extra two and a half hours to pick up the TV, then drive two hours home. I see. OK. That's why I come to the hall on the way back. Ah. It goes to the hall. From the query. Ah. The hall from the query. The same table. Oh, it's an extra two and a half hours? No, no. It goes to how? The same top. The same top. No, no, it's half an hour extra. Right. How big is it? 43. Small. Very small. Let's get this right. That's really... That's a lot. Oh, it's not a TV. Oh, look. Oh, wow, they're so photorealistic. There's a big edge on the back. Yeah, that looks like a lot. John. Stefan. Yes. Who's next? Wow. That's it. It's the biggest car. The biggest car has the least people. How does that work? TV. Then you have to come with me. All right. To visit the hobble. There is no bathrooms. The builder hasn't finished. He doesn't know what he's wearing. There are a variety of trees. Old fashioned way. Do you want to talk to him a little bit? It's kind of going from here to here. It's kind of going from here to here. It's kind of going from here to here. It's kind of going from here to here. It's kind of going from here to here. It's kind of going from here to here. It's kind of going from here to here. It's kind of going from here to here. It's kind of going from here to about? It's kind of going from here to here. You go like that. It's kind of in the middle. No problem. We can actually stop for a nice lunch on the way back there. You don't stop for a nice lunch. You have a lot of food in the car. We can't stop to eat it. We can find somewhere nice to eat something on the way back. How is Dean going home? By taxi. From here to the Louvre? No, thanks. If he helps out in the weather, it might be nice to see you. I think we should do that, yes. Don't worry about the TV. You guys don't see the TV. No, but we can take the TV. Probably not. It is. Faria, not at all. You know, we're just... I like Cape Fowl. We can do that. Then you can visit the kitchen. We'll do, yes, there's some light-sized, small-sized area. Yeah. We can do that. Then you can visit. We can do that. We can do that. We can do that. We can do that. We can do that. We can do that. We can do that. We can do that. We can do that. We can do that. We can do that. We can do that. We can do that. We can do that. We can do that. We can do that. We can do that. We can do that. We can do that. We can do that. We can do that. We can do that. We can do that. We can do that. We can start of time. Because when we were coming to you... Do you have lots of luggage? I have a small suitcase. Oh, I do need to check it. You also have a ladder. So that I really have to take care of. If I had known how tight it would be in the car, I would have taken probably even taller. Okay, were you okay with that then? Yeah. And Val comes with us. The orange step on along the corridor. You go to the smaller cliffs. So I see you. And I look up here. And have a napalm? I thought that was a good idea. I'm going to try straight to Iceland. I'm going to go to a very, very... Castle, you go to on the way to Galway, I think. By the sea, it's very nice. There's like half an acre there. Outline is faded. Just to see, you know, it's a beautiful area. I think so, yeah. Just the other day a colleague was telling me that he went here for the family, you know. He spent a week, you know. It feels unusual, you know, like the very best people. A couple of days I've seen of days in Konamara. There's a national park here, it's really quite beautiful."
"The provided video segment shows a person in a kitchen. The person is interacting with bottles of water, and placing them on a counter. This action is best classified as **Drinking** because it involves handling beverages.",1488,1718," That was crazy. Oh my god! This is awesome, isn't it? Thank you, we're happy to be here. Thank you, Werner and Stefan. Now that we solved the when question, I think we also solved the what question. Yeah, I'm fine. That was scheduled for Monday, September 1st. Yeah, it was the lunch before the snack factory, so I think maybe if we had something lighter for that day, it would have been better. The thing that needs to be considered in advance, dishes that take a long time to prepare should probably not be scheduled for lunch. I think they take a long time could take one time. Okay. Can you stop now? Can you stop now? But then again, a lasagna could be a lunch because you couldn't even do it the day before and then just put it on the table. That might actually be a lunch. Basically, I have to put it in the oven before the work comes. Okay. Okay, great. But then lasagna should be lunched on Thursday, so you can prepare it tomorrow afternoon and then it is ready and then we can just put it in the oven. Can I have the cheese please? Do we have nothing else? We have a different deal, it's a pseudo deal. How do you know there's nothing of the veal meal? The veal meals? The veal meal? Why would we not do that? The map might show us. There's two people with eyes on the beef now. We have to make sure we have enough beef. How many kilograms of beef do you need? However many specified... How many of them eat beef and eat veal? Yes. The young beef. It's a 1.5 year old cow. It's specifically young beef. What type of beef? Silver or veal. Do you mean to make it something that we can actually appreciate? Something that's not killed with this? I asked him about veal and he said, well, they eat it. I'm thinking of some other place. I asked him about the bill, and he said, what a deal. Not that it's watching. What a deal. At least that's service. Yes, he will buy the bill. Did we say that we had too much cheese yeah okay so then tomorrow what's the plan for food let's just get this figured out because we have too many messages tomorrow they are going to do a lot of chatting different dishes this guy is going do a baguette for Thursday, but for tomorrow? Yeah. For lunch. I can do something on our top. I can do, tomorrow I can do whatever. Wednesday, Wednesday. That's the one we ate, I want Indian tomorrow. Wednesday or Indian. So, Indian. So, is that a lunch or a dinner? It's Indian. So we have two recipes, so daum and aloo gobi. That sounds like a dinner. But beef stew is dinner. Daum is just beef. You can take it anytime. We can do a light breakfast tomorrow. It's not very heavy. We can dip it in our sauce for breakfast tomorrow. Yeah. We don't necessarily do this part. We are chopping ourselves up. I don't know if you can... Oh, please stop. Oh, he actually can. He can. Because we put the chocolate in afterwards. Yeah. I can put chocolate in and it fills in. So, I don't know if it's the way you like. But do you need to make the dough from scratch? Oh, yeah. Oh, okay. Don't talk to me in three minutes. What do you need for the dough? They are already filled, this chap? I'm not sure that we're getting over there. I'll make it to the middle, because I don't know if you need an American powder. I'm not sure we have that. OK. Let me try this again. By the way, do you order the puff pastry? Puff pastry? No, we ordered the puff pastry. We just magically give you the list. No, we have puff pastry, but a snack that we thought would be useful. Because there's a cheese inside. Ah, yes. Pizza rolls or something. Yeah, or chocolate inside, like chocolate rolls. I like a dessert. Okay. I'm going to have a drink. Okay. I'm going to have a drink. Okay. I'm going to have a drink. Okay. I'm going to have a drink. Okay. I'm going to have a drink. Okay. I'm going to have a drink. Okay. I'm going to have a drink. dessert. Okay. Oh, we have a table. Thank you. That was very good. I know. I can't think of anything from today. You never need this. Isn't it a waste? You never need dessert. That's not the point of dessert. Okay, so tomorrow we have the deviant and the mullet please. Yeah, on Thursday we have pasta and something. That's that one, right? Lasagna. That's toast then. I'm Kostein night. Okay, curry and pasta and lasagne. On Friday we only eat lunch not too late. So why don't you want the the turkey? Oh, the mizrushki. Yes, mizrushki, exactly. For which we specifically wasted the 6 kilograms of potatoes. Which we have to... Not to fry, but to cook. No, no, I guess what we want to do is... We will use the potato stews for my curry. We actually use a lot of potatoes. This is exactly what I meant, so I'm adding recipes to a list, but then not adding more days, right? How about seven days? There's only so many meals. Well, perhaps a little Sunday, we can add one part. The chicken with skin. Yeah. Okay, why don't we replace the meat stew with the chicken hot pot? Hi. Okay. Lucky is all the veal for... Okay, when do you want that? Simulation veal. I'm going to have some carrots here on Friday. Which one do you want? It's probably more over evening or anything thing. Okay. Why don't we do the chicken on Friday for lunch? Yeah. And what about tomorrow? Tomorrow we're doing... But then, if we already have a bunch of stuff for recipes, then why don't we prioritize the recipes for which we already have the stuff, rather than going shopping for more recipes that we don't actually have slots for in the schedule? OK, so let's take it back to. If you're not doing beef steak, what are you doing with chicken? Sous-l'Oviel. You don't have to go all that. When is that? Sous-l'Oviel is gone. That's going to be Thursday. Or Wednesday. OK, we're going to have to decide, though. I can't just say, wait, we can't just say, wait, we can't just say, wait, we can't just say, wait, we can't just say, wait, we can't just say, wait, we can't just say, wait, we can't just say, wait, we can't just say, wait, we can't just say, wait, we can't just say, wait, we can't just say, wait, we can't just say, wait, we can't just say, wait, we can't Okay, this is infuriating. list.
