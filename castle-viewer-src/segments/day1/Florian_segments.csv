Sitting,1183,1184," It's going gotta be sausage. Some meat maybe? Sausage? That would be a pretty safe guess. And a smoked salmon factory tour on How Fast Will You Run. I wonder what they serve. We will get a taster and probably a package takeaway. Yeah. But there is no cameras, right? No, there can't be cameras at a smoked salmon factory. I'm afraid. Can you take smoked salmon just like that without fridge? I wouldn't write. Well, it will last, it will keep a few days.

"The image shows a hallway with wooden flooring and cream-colored walls. There are doors on either side of the hallway. The hallway also features a white radiator on the right side. The lighting in the hallway is warm and inviting.

In the foreground, there is a tiled wall with a light switch. The tiles are a dark brown color and are laid in a subway pattern. The light switch is white and is located on the tiled wall.

The overall impression of the image is one of a clean and well-maintained hallway.

Based on the provided categories, the most fitting classification for this image is **Walking**. This is because the image depicts a hallway, which is a common area for walking from one room to another. While other activities might occur in a hallway, the visual cues in the image, such as the perspective and the open space, most strongly suggest movement through the hallway.",1657,1658," Eh...

"The image shows people in a kitchen. One person is facing away from the camera and appears to be standing near a counter, possibly preparing something. Another person is in the background, also in the kitchen. The presence of food items on the counter and the kitchen setting suggest activities related to food or drink. However, without more context or clearer actions, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific category.

Based on the visual information, the most fitting general category would be **Cooking** or a related activity within the kitchen environment. If more specific actions were visible, a more precise classification could be made.",2983,2985," i have good news and bad news where's kakal? Kachel needs to know the good news and the bad news.

No, no, no, remove the mirror from the wall. This is... You actually get the lectern. So professional. Okay, look, let's keep going. Welcome to Castle. Live Castle. Why are we here? Leading researchers, that's you, to define the challenge, the next great challenge for working with life on video data. The background is, there was a call from SIG-MM for expressions of interest for some multimedia- activities for the community right and um Klaus decided to put in a bid and I worked with him on it and that bid was successful yeah that led to this and I think there were four or five bids that were successful we saw a validation multimedia last year or this year a few months ago, and the bid was successful on the base that we host a workshop to define a challenge for ACM Multimedia Conference in Dublin in 2025 that is something to do with life logs and video. That's the challenge. That's why we're here. We then decided it wouldn't be great, rather than just have a workshop, to have a workshop and data gathering experiment at the same time. Hence we end up in the end of the world west of Ireland where nobody else exists and that's why we're here. Okay that's why you're all wearing cameras. Not every camera is straight but let's just go with that. Arising from castle 24 i.e. this week, we'll run a new challenge of ASA Multimedia in Dublin. Yay! We will release an epic new data set for the community to use. And we will hopefully, in the course of the one hour or one hour and a half every day this week we actually spend in a formalized workshop setting, define the next steps in video life logging research okay and then if I have to support the community to grow and be more impactful that's why we're here so does that there's a work element there's a day to gather gammons and I should be a full element to this whole thing to make sense yes yes okay that's what we find out here and the plan for castle 24 today, 3rd of December, isn't it 3rd of December? I have an unnamed year. We will begin workshop and data set gathering. I opened the slides last night, look at where he's at. Also, on the previous slide, you said, well, next year in 2025. Castle 24. Okay, we now know. Okay, we can't change it now. Castle 24. It's the 24th edition of the Castle. So we're going to gather a data set which every participant gains in realistic and safe POV, lifelogging of every deck. Safe because we're not going out interacting with people. We're in a closed environment. Rules we have to follow which Luke will run through with you include things like not wearing the cameras in the bathroom, stuff like that. We just don't want to know. Wednesday the 4th, Thursday the 5th of December, we continue to do what we're doing now. We'll have a large breakfast, we'll continue to gather today, we'll continue to have our workshops. Friday the the 5th of December you tend to finalise the plans for a Grand Challenge, chart the way forward for the research community, find the next steps for this group, what comes out of this, and then finalise the data gathering which will happen over the coming month or two because there's quite a lot of data, quite a lot of work to be done on that.

Friday the the 5th of December you tend to finalise the plans for a Grand Challenge, chart the way forward for the research community, find the next steps for this group, what comes out of this, and then finalise the data gathering which will happen over the coming month or two because there's quite a lot of data, quite a lot of work to be done on that. And then on Saturday we go back home. So that's basically it. We have a social activity or two."

I think enough. 4 to be... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Count yourself, men. Oh, it's Luca. enough count yourself man look how you're missing what I'm just gonna squeeze in somewhere here. Yeah, yeah, totally. I'm just gonna go by myself. Okay. Okay. Can you control it for me? No, I'm subtle. Oh, no? Okay, let's go. One hour and five minutes late. That's a success, man. Castle. With this name. I wanted to book a castle but I couldn't afford it. I planned to book a castle but they became too expensive so next year if we get a bigger grant we can go to a castle Yeah! Castle proper. We can have a brainstorming session. There is a, there is a, or at least there was an acronym at some point. I don't think anyone wrote it down. But it's really a conference called Castle, right? No, no, no. Experiment. Castle Experiment. We talked about Life Castle. It's, well, yeah well yeah. Life logging experiment. There has to be, will be at some point an acronym for this. Conference? No no conference. People call it also. Academic scientists who think life logging. Little. It's there. It's there. Something something. Oh no. Oh no hang on. It's all gone. It's all gone.. The HDMI cable connection isn't great. Yay! Do you need the clicker? I think I make it. I need a table. We can have a chair. Take this one. Is Castle actually registered with the trademark office? No, it's not. This is what you get if you use gender to pay high. There is a mirror. No, no, no, remove the mirror from the wall. This is... You actually get the lectern. So professional. Okay, look, let's keep going. Welcome to Castle. Live Castle. Why are we here? Leading researchers, that's you, to define the challenge, the next great challenge for working with life on video data. The background is, there was a call from SIG-MM for expressions of interest for some multimedia- activities for the community right and um Klaus decided to put in a bid and I worked with him on it and that bid was successful yeah that led to this and I think there were four or five bids that were successful we saw a validation multimedia last year or this year a few months ago, and the bid was successful on the base that we host a workshop to define a challenge for ACM Multimedia Conference in Dublin in 2025 that is something to do with life logs and video. That's the challenge. That's why we're here. We then decided it wouldn't be great, rather than just have a workshop, to have a workshop and data gathering experiment at the same time. Hence we end up in the end of the world west of Ireland where nobody else exists and that's why we're here. Okay that's why you're all wearing cameras. Not every camera is straight but let's just go with that. Arising from castle 24 i.e. this week, we'll run a new challenge of ASA Multimedia in Dublin. Yay! We will release an epic new data set for the community to use. And we will hopefully, in the course of the one hour or one hour and a half every day this week we actually spend in a formalized workshop setting, define the next steps in video life logging research okay and then if I have to support the community to grow and be more impactful that's why we're here so does that there's a work element there's a day to gather gammons and I should be a full element to this whole thing to make sense yes yes okay that's what we find out here and the plan for castle 24 today, 3rd of December, isn't it 3rd of December? I have an unnamed year. We will begin workshop and data set gathering. I opened the slides last night, look at where he's at. Also, on the previous slide, you said, well, next year in 2025. Castle 24. Okay, we now know. Okay, we can't change it now. Castle 24. It's the 24th edition of the Castle. So we're going to gather a data set which every participant gains in realistic and safe POV, lifelogging of every deck. Safe because we're not going out interacting with people. We're in a closed environment. Rules we have to follow which Luke will run through with you include things like not wearing the cameras in the bathroom, stuff like that. We just don't want to know.

I think enough. 4 to be... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Count yourself, men. Oh, it's Luca. enough count yourself man look how you're missing what I'm just gonna squeeze in somewhere here. Yeah, yeah, totally. I'm just gonna go by myself. Okay. Okay. Can you control it for me? No, I'm subtle. Oh, no? Okay, let's go. One hour and five minutes late. That's a success, man. Castle. With this name. I wanted to book a castle but I couldn't afford it. I planned to book a castle but they became too expensive so next year if we get a bigger grant we can go to a castle Yeah! Castle proper. We can have a brainstorming session. There is a, there is a, or at least there was an acronym at some point. I don't think anyone wrote it down. But it's really a conference called Castle, right? No, no, no. Experiment. Castle Experiment. We talked about Life Castle. It's, well, yeah well yeah. Life logging experiment. There has to be, will be at some point an acronym for this. Conference? No no conference. People call it also. Academic scientists who think life logging. Little. It's there. It's there. Something something. Oh no. Oh no hang on. It's all gone. It's all gone.. The HDMI cable connection isn't great. Yay! Do you need the clicker? I think I make it. I need a table. We can have a chair. Take this one. Is Castle actually registered with the trademark office? No, it's not. This is what you get if you use gender to pay high. There is a mirror. No, no, no, remove the mirror from the wall. This is... You actually get the lectern. So professional. Okay, look, let's keep going. Welcome to Castle. Live Castle. Why are we here? Leading researchers, that's you, to define the challenge, the next great challenge for working with life on video data. The background is, there was a call from SIG-MM for expressions of interest for some multimedia- activities for the community right and um Klaus decided to put in a bid and I worked with him on it and that bid was successful yeah that led to this and I think there were four or five bids that were successful we saw a validation multimedia last year or this year a few months ago, and the bid was successful on the base that we host a workshop to define a challenge for ACM Multimedia Conference in Dublin in 2025 that is something to do with life logs and video. That's the challenge. That's why we're here. We then decided it wouldn't be great, rather than just have a workshop, to have a workshop and data gathering experiment at the same time. Hence we end up in the end of the world west of Ireland where nobody else exists and that's why we're here. Okay that's why you're all wearing cameras. Not every camera is straight but let's just go with that. Arising from castle 24 i.e. this week, we'll run a new challenge of ASA Multimedia in Dublin. Yay! We will release an epic new data set for the community to use. And we will hopefully, in the course of the one hour or one hour and a half every day this week we actually spend in a formalized workshop setting, define the next steps in video life logging research okay and then if I have to support the community to grow and be more impactful that's why we're here so does that there's a work element there's a day to gather gammons and I should be a full element to this whole thing to make sense yes yes okay that's what we find out here and the plan for castle 24 today, 3rd of December, isn't it 3rd of December? I have an unnamed year. We will begin workshop and data set gathering. I opened the slides last night, look at where he's at. Also, on the previous slide, you said, well, next year in 2025. Castle 24. Okay, we now know. Okay, we can't change it now. Castle 24. It's the 24th edition of the Castle. So we're going to gather a data set which every participant gains in realistic and safe POV, lifelogging of every deck. Safe because we're not going out interacting with people. We're in a closed environment. Rules we have to follow which Luke will run through with you include things like not wearing the cameras in the bathroom, stuff like that. We just don't want to know. Wednesday the 4th, Thursday the 5th of December, we continue to do what we're doing now. We'll have a large breakfast, we'll continue to gather today, we'll continue to have our workshops. Friday the the 5th of December you tend to finalise the plans for a Grand Challenge, chart the way forward for the research community, find the next steps for this group, what comes out of this, and then finalise the data gathering which will happen over the coming month or two because there's quite a lot of data, quite a lot of work to be done on that. And then on Saturday we go back home. So that's basically it. We have a social activity or two."

Castle proper. We can have a brainstorming session. There is a, there is a, or at least there was an acronym at some point. I don't think anyone wrote it down. But it's really a conference called Castle, right? No, no, no. Experiment. Castle Experiment. We talked about Life Castle. It's, well, yeah well yeah. Life logging experiment. There has to be, will be at some point an acronym for this. Conference? No no conference. People call it also. Academic scientists who think life logging. Little. It's there. It's there. Something something. Oh no. Oh no hang on. It's all gone. It's all gone.. The HDMI cable connection isn't great. Yay! Do you need the clicker? I think I make it. I need a table. We can have a chair. Take this one. Is Castle actually registered with the trademark office? No, it's not. This is what you get if you use gender to pay high. There is a mirror. No, no, no, remove the mirror from the wall. This is... You actually get the lectern. So professional. Okay, look, let's keep going. Welcome to Castle. Live Castle. Why are we here? Leading researchers, that's you, to define the challenge, the next great challenge for working with life on video data. The background is, there was a call from SIG-MM for expressions of interest for some multimedia- activities for the community right and um Klaus decided to put in a bid and I worked with him on it and that bid was successful yeah that led to this and I think there were four or five bids that were successful we saw a validation multimedia last year or this year a few months ago, and the bid was successful on the base that we host a workshop to define a challenge for ACM Multimedia Conference in Dublin in 2025 that is something to do with life logs and video. That's the challenge. That's why we're here. We then decided it wouldn't be great, rather than just have a workshop, to have a workshop and data gathering experiment at the same time. Hence we end up in the end of the world west of Ireland where nobody else exists and that's why we're here. Okay that's why you're all wearing cameras. Not every camera is straight but let's just go with that. Arising from castle 24 i.e. this week, we'll run a new challenge of ASA Multimedia in Dublin. Yay! We will release an epic new data set for the community to use. And we will hopefully, in the course of the one hour or one hour and a half every day this week we actually spend in a formalized workshop setting, define the next steps in video life logging research okay and then if I have to support the community to grow and be more impactful that's why we're here so does that there's a work element there's a day to gather gammons and I should be a full element to this whole thing to make sense yes yes okay that's what we find out here and the plan for castle 24 today, 3rd of December, isn't it 3rd of December? I have an unnamed year. We will begin workshop and data set gathering. I opened the slides last night, look at where he's at. Also, on the previous slide, you said, well, next year in 2025. Castle 24. Okay, we now know. Okay, we can't change it now. Castle 24. It's the 24th edition of the Castle. So we're going to gather a data set which every participant gains in realistic and safe POV, lifelogging of every deck. Safe because we're not going out interacting with people. We're in a closed environment. Rules we have to follow which Luke will run through with you include things like not wearing the cameras in the bathroom, stuff like that. We just don't want to know. Wednesday the 4th, Thursday the 5th of December, we continue to do what we're doing now. We'll have a large breakfast, we'll continue to gather today, we'll continue to have our workshops. Friday the the 5th of December you tend to finalise the plans for a Grand Challenge, chart the way forward for the research community, find the next steps for this group, what comes out of this, and then finalise the data gathering which will happen over the coming month or two because there's quite a lot of data, quite a lot of work to be done on that. And then on Saturday we go back home. So that's basically it. We have a social activity or two."

Something something. Oh no. Oh no hang on. It's all gone. It's all gone.. The HDMI cable connection isn't great. Yay! Do you need the clicker? I think I make it. I need a table. We can have a chair. Take this one. Is Castle actually registered with the trademark office? No, it's not. This is what you get if you use gender to pay high. There is a mirror. No, no, no, remove the mirror from the wall. This is... You actually get the lectern. So professional. Okay, look, let's keep going. Welcome to Castle. Live Castle. Why are we here? Leading researchers, that's you, to define the challenge, the next great challenge for working with life on video data. The background is, there was a call from SIG-MM for expressions of interest for some multimedia- activities for the community right and um Klaus decided to put in a bid and I worked with him on it and that bid was successful yeah that led to this and I think there were four or five bids that were successful we saw a validation multimedia last year or this year a few months ago, and the bid was successful on the base that we host a workshop to define a challenge for ACM Multimedia Conference in Dublin in 2025 that is something to do with life logs and video. That's the challenge. That's why we're here. We then decided it wouldn't be great, rather than just have a workshop, to have a workshop and data gathering experiment at the same time. Hence we end up in the end of the world west of Ireland where nobody else exists and that's why we're here. Okay that's why you're all wearing cameras. Not every camera is straight but let's just go with that. Arising from castle 24 i.e. this week, we'll run a new challenge of ASA Multimedia in Dublin. Yay! We will release an epic new data set for the community to use. And we will hopefully, in the course of the one hour or one hour and a half every day this week we actually spend in a formalized workshop setting, define the next steps in video life logging research okay and then if I have to support the community to grow and be more impactful that's why we're here so does that there's a work element there's a day to gather gammons and I should be a full element to this whole thing to make sense yes yes okay that's what we find out here and the plan for castle 24 today, 3rd of December, isn't it 3rd of December? I have an unnamed year. We will begin workshop and data set gathering. I opened the slides last night, look at where he's at. Also, on the previous slide, you said, well, next year in 2025. Castle 24. Okay, we now know. Okay, we can't change it now. Castle 24. It's the 24th edition of the Castle. So we're going to gather a data set which every participant gains in realistic and safe POV, lifelogging of every deck. Safe because we're not going out interacting with people. We're in a closed environment. Rules we have to follow which Luke will run through with you include things like not wearing the cameras in the bathroom, stuff like that. We just don't want to know. Wednesday the 4th, Thursday the 5th of December, we continue to do what we're doing now. We'll have a large breakfast, we'll continue to gather today, we'll continue to have our workshops. Friday the the 5th of December you tend to finalise the plans for a Grand Challenge, chart the way forward for the research community, find the next steps for this group, what comes out of this, and then finalise the data gathering which will happen over the coming month or two because there's quite a lot of data, quite a lot of work to be done on that. And then on Saturday we go back home. So that's basically it. We have a social activity or two."

Yeah, yeah, totally. I'm just gonna go by myself. Okay. Okay. Can you control it for me? No, I'm subtle. Oh, no? Okay, let's go. One hour and five minutes late. That's a success, man. Castle. With this name. I wanted to book a castle but I couldn't afford it. I planned to book a castle but they became too expensive so next year if we get a bigger grant we can go to a castle Yeah!

The background is, there was a call from SIG-MM for expressions of interest for some multimedia- activities for the community right and um Klaus decided to put in a bid and I worked with him on it and that bid was successful yeah that led to this and I think there were four or five bids that were successful we saw a validation multimedia last year or this year a few months ago, and the bid was successful on the base that we host a workshop to define a challenge for ACM Multimedia Conference in Dublin in 2025 that is something to do with life logs and video. That's the challenge. That's why we're here. We then decided it wouldn't be great, rather than just have a workshop, to have a workshop and data gathering experiment at the same time. Hence we end up in the end of the world west of Ireland where nobody else exists and that's why we're here. Okay that's why you're all wearing cameras. Not every camera is straight but let's just go with that. Arising from castle 24 i.e. this week, we'll run a new challenge of ASA Multimedia in Dublin. Yay! We will release an epic new data set for the community to use. And we will hopefully, in the course of the one hour or one hour and a half every day this week we actually spend in a formalized workshop setting, define the next steps in video life logging research okay and then if I have to support the community to grow and be more impactful that's why we're here so does that there's a work element there's a day to gather gammons and I should be a full element to this whole thing to make sense yes yes okay that's what we find out here and the plan for castle 24 today, 3rd of December, isn't it 3rd of December? I have an unnamed year. We will begin workshop and data set gathering. I opened the slides last night, look at where he's at. Also, on the previous slide, you said, well, next year in 2025. Castle 24. Okay, we now know. Okay, we can't change it now. Castle 24. It's the 24th edition of the Castle. So we're going to gather a data set which every participant gains in realistic and safe POV, lifelogging of every deck. Safe because we're not going out interacting with people. We're in a closed environment. Rules we have to follow which Luke will run through with you include things like not wearing the cameras in the bathroom, stuff like that. We just don't want to know. Wednesday the 4th, Thursday the 5th of December, we continue to do what we're doing now. We'll have a large breakfast, we'll continue to gather today, we'll continue to have our workshops. Friday the the 5th of December you tend to finalise the plans for a Grand Challenge, chart the way forward for the research community, find the next steps for this group, what comes out of this, and then finalise the data gathering which will happen over the coming month or two because there's quite a lot of data, quite a lot of work to be done on that. And then on Saturday we go back home. So that's basically it. We have a social activity or two."

"**Meeting**

**Explanation:**

The image depicts a group of people gathered in a living room, with some individuals seated and others standing. A large screen is displaying text, likely a presentation or a shared visual. The overall atmosphere suggests a structured gathering where information is being shared or discussed. The presence of laptops and the attentive posture of the individuals point towards a professional or educational context, characteristic of a meeting.",692,694,

Meeting,696,1437," yes so hopefully why are we wearing the same shirt man? When you become elderly person you buy this brand and then as soon it becomes the same color even. I brought my ICMR one because I thought more people would have that and we get confusable on camera. I didn't think that far. Yeah, actually we think that this data set might be usable for the LiveLog search engine but also maybe for the video browser showdown. I will give a very short introduction what it actually is. So what is it? It's a live evaluation platform for interactive video search which really performs large-scale video content retrieval and we have different types of queries, I'll give some examples, and we have a competitive setup because we have not only a large data set but we have also a lot of participants and yeah it's going for several hours. It's also an entertaining event because it's connected to the welcome reception at the MMM conference every year. And so this is how it looks like. It started in 2012 in Klagenfurt and then we went every year to different places at the MMM conference. And what you can see here on the right, this is the last iteration in 2024. and next year we will continue this in january with 16 teams actually and here we can also see that a lot of different teams from all around the world have participated in this competition there are some very strong teams one of them of course is from the University of Basel, one from Charles University in Prague and another one from PISA. Yeah, and a few more of course, there are so many teams that I cannot mention them all. And the query types, we have known item search, where you know what you are looking for visually, Alsoually the second one so that would be a visual example and it seems to find this as fast as possible and i only see this small clip and the texture one would be a description like a girl and a man run up a small hill. There is a flagpole with a Canadian flag on top. There are white green benches, a lamp post and stairs up the hill. The flagpole is on top of a stone structure with a cannon. I think this was a very challenging task actually. I could hardly imagine how it looked like. Yeah, and that would be the scene. It takes a boy, it takes a man. Right, so we were going to see the flagpole, the Canadian flag. Right, okay, then we have visual question answering. Somehow I did not have enough time. But we have a question answering like this. How many nights do we see passing in the video until this segment? I think this is very interesting because you also need the video playback functionality and quickly go over the video. And of course you need to understand that the darkness outside could be an indication of how many nights you see in the video and we have well if the license of the dataset is okay, then this should be all Creative Commons license. Well, it should be. Yeah, you never know. It should be. It should be. All of these videos are Creative Commons licensed. Yeah. But... We're relying on somebody else. Yes. Some of these people who made these videos are not entirely versed in the intricacies of licensing, so there may be... They're not all lawyers? They're prob... Look, I talk to lawyers too much. Okay, yeah. Anyway, so this is from B3C. Should be fine. And then we have ad talk video search where we need to find as many as possible items for a specific topic."
Meeting,1437,1441,
Meeting,1441,1535," If you signed up to use the Liferay data set If you sign up to use the Liferay dataset, you sign up to rules that says we can ask you to delete any image and you must do it, or delete the whole dataset. We haven't had to do that, but that's in there. Okay, so type of queries, just as VBS has spoken about, we have known item, ad hoc, and Q&A queries. Known item queries find a particular image of an event, right, or activity that meets the information need. I'll look at an example of that. This was an example from two years ago. There was a man in the front row with a yellow hat on. I was on a stage in a room with a lot of people watching. I was on some sort of panel writing notes. I remember the man had a blue sweater on also. It was in France at AC Multimedia 2018. Over the course of three minutes, you get more detail given to you. 19. I can't read. But that's an example of the picture that we have here. Look, ad hoc queries. Find all the examples of something important. Like, find all the times I was taking medication or vitamins at home. Imagine a scenario where a physician cares about this in an elderly person living alone. You want to quantify this kind of information. Or find examples when I was wearing my yellow Happy Bee t-shirt. And it's a very nice t-shirt actually. Finally, Q&A. Most interestingly, this is what the real challenge is right now. Because we can kind of do finding content, and even aggregation of finding content. Q&A, I visited a famous Korean temple with friends, actually some of them are here, a few years ago. What did I do immediately afterwards? We got a coffee. Tea! Tea. It was a tea shop. Oh, so you're anonymously in this day and age.. They even green tea cheesecake, you know. Oh yeah, it had matcha cheesecake. Actually, that is you. Might even be the same shirt. No, no, no. I cannot fit into that. So much for anonymization, but okay, sure. It's a blurred blurry face it's only recognizable to people who know really well also is is he wearing his name tag no he's not no not on this one no that's actually the cake because this is from seoul okay but by the shade you can even guess who's the summer of 2019 want to call them again to get my car this is a real kind of challenge right what was the name of the company we went to a number of years ago and then even more complicated the one that nobody got right last year what errand did I fly most often within 2019 real complex aggregation theories but that's what we're pushing for that's what we're aiming for here the issue with all of these data sets is that their image sequence two images a minute I'm trying to push beyond that now and then of course this that's what we think now is a standard lifeline search engine right which really focuses on visual embeddings multimodal embeddings as a key access mechanism once again intuitive interface is"

Thank you. Let's go. We're going to have Luca to tell us what we're doing and how we should do it properly and all the mistakes we're making and we shouldn't do. Okay so I didn't have slides for this. This is more going to be a bit of a show and tell. So just to give you a bit of technical detail on how this all is actually working.

**Reasoning:** The individuals in the image appear to be gathered in a living room setting, with some seated and others standing. The presence of a laptop on the coffee table and the focused attention of some individuals suggest a work-related or collaborative gathering.

Leisure Activities,1725,1805,
Meeting,1805,2042," Thank you. eight or so hours, depending on what's actually going on, of recording capacity per camera per day. These recordings are not necessarily continuous. You can interrupt them at any time. Whenever you're doing something that you may not want to be on the record, you can interrupt this at any time. Again, important, just pause the recording, do not turn off the camera, because if you turn off the camera, it goes out of sync, and all the timing issues, and it might also then complain about starting up, it has some not enough power issues, because it's not actually powered from the internal battery. Just a hint also do not touch the touchscreen. Yes, try not to touch the touchscreen because it is very swipey, right? You might accidentally change the mode or something so try to only use the top button. Also it is blinking whenever it is recording so I can now see when look at all of you, that all of your cameras are actually blinking, so all of you will be recording what I'm telling you. If you happen to see somebody walking around and their camera is not blinking, do let them know, because that might not be intentional. Do you also have a feeling of this Strange Days cyberpunk movie from... Do you remember that one, 20-some years ago? I don't know. I haven't seen it. I didn't see it either. Okay. Crazy movie. We all look reasonable, though, right? Yeah. Honestly, I thought it would be weirder. Could be worse. Could be worse. Could be worse. So, in order to facilitate this long-form recording, you are also all wearing pouches or other types of batteries. So this is a 20-amp hour battery. It has plenty of capacity to run this camera until the SD card is full. we will recharge these every night as well. So every night data is copied off, you get the fresh SD card in the fully charged battery bank in the morning. In addition to the cameras you're all wearing, there's some stationary cameras, there's one over there, there's one over there, and there's two more in this part of the house, and then one additional one in the other room. At least the four in here are set to record continuously for the entire day, so they should each record 12, 13 hours depending on when exactly we stop for the day to essentially anchor the activities of all the individual effects. What we will do afterwards is to ideally frame level align all these videos so they're perfectly synced in time or at least as perfect as we can make them. We don't actually know the the clock drift of these cameras so we will have to see how what level of precision is actually achievable with this but this is going to be a post-processing problem. Maybe a good computer vision task actually for later. There's going to be some interesting things. So there's going to be some pre-processing that we're doing. Stratis and these people, he got an ERC for this line of time, arrow of time type of tasks. Time alignment task is interesting. Yeah, but the time alignment will probably need to happen before we actually release this. Yeah, it will, anyway. There's a bunch of things that... So, essentially a series of tasks, right? So, we will generate the raw data with the sensors and with some more sensors that I'm going into in a minute. And then there's essentially multiple stages, right? There will be some processing on this"

Meeting,2825,2902," The interesting part is that the whole process will be somewhat self-documenting, because the whole process of setting up this challenge and defining the precise task of the challenge will be part of the data set that will be used for the challenge. So people can get all the documentation they could possibly need because they can just watch us coming up with the details. So basically you just give a data set and say the challenge is in the data set? Yes. Essentially yes. I'll find the queries in a day. Essentially, yes. Það er að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við hluti að við h find all the query, this is hard mode. I think this is really amazing also for this, I would say it's not new, we've always wanted to go fully unsupervised with everything, any supervision can only get you there, but we have so much data now and even overlap in streams, I think this is going to be super kind of interesting for self-supervised folks. Right, right, yes. And I mean this is only the first step, right, because this is all off-the-shelf hardware. So what is also an intent of this workshop here is to think beyond what we're currently able to do. What's the next workshop going to look like? And see if we had infinite budget and infinite time, what would we want to do? And then essentially boil this down to given that we are presumably not going to have infinite budget and infinite time,"
Meeting,2902,3009," So I think maybe even more ambitious goal would be in order because you remember the first session at AC Multimedia, they were talking about a future and about multimedia agents and so on. I think maybe we have to even think, hey, not in terms of how do we want, actually that's what they would like us to think about. How would we like the entire field to moving at least with regard to one of these lines that's what the hackathon conversation at AC Multimedia was about that particular information workshop where the hackathon came out of that was all about the future challenges for the community not only this workshop but kind of in general yes,. But all of this hinges on actually having concrete material to work with. And this is going to be one set of data, right? And this has properties that will be unique among the available datasets, because this is not going to be the first POV activity data set. There are a handful of these and they have been studied quite a bit. But all of these have the limitation that they're either longer form activities in a very confined environment or that they're very diverse activities in diverse environments that are completely disjointed, so you just have a few recordings of a few minutes, some person doing something and then this is gone and you never know what happened before or what happened after. Usually this is also happening in public, therefore it's heavily anonymized."

Predict this solely based on my heart rate, right? Things like that. It's going to be epic. Long ago. Yeah. So again, the thing is, this will have overlap with types of data that exist. So we will also be able to take inspirations on the kind of tasks that people have been doing with other types of data that has the overlapping aspects. But this is going to have aspects that do not exist, because we have many people in the same environment interacting with each other and with the environment.

Meeting,3120,3156," So ideally and what do you what the agenda says that we essentially threw out of the window because we started an hour late, is to today start this brainstorming, this ideation process jointly. And then when people want to discuss this throughout the day, please do. And we will have another round tomorrow morning where we essentially gather the various things people came up with. And then go on from there and we have some more discussion points on hackathon things. The plan is about 90 minutes every morning of workshop. That should lead to a proposal for a grand challenge at ACM Multimedia and a proposal for a hackathon at ACM Multimedia. And the idea of what would happen for Castle 2. Wait a second, when you say hackathon at ACM Multimedia, we don't normally have hackathons. We have different formats of grand challenges. No, this is new. This is new. Came out of the ACM Next Steps Multimedia workshop that we have. And hackathon, would people start working on it before? Because some Grand Challenges have that form. This is independent. Like the social media. Two independent activities. So the format of the Grand Challenge is going to be the same as any Grand Challenge. It has a long-term schedule. We will release the dataset as soon as we are able able we will release the tasks as soon as we're able people can sign up people can download all the data they need they can work on it they will submit the results we will evaluate those submissions we will tell them how well they did they will submit their papers about... It would be really good to have a paper also ready before it yes there's some there will need to be a dataset paper oh but how are we gonna manage it before February March well the dataset paper will need to go out as a preprint and the final version of the dataset paper then goes out with a dataset track available to be determined. Yes, because we are also planning to have a dataset track newly created for 4.25. So it might go into the Grand Challenge track, details to be determined, but the preprint will definitely need to go out together with the dataset and also the challenge description independently of that. So for the dataset track we are gonna have to think really hard because SIGAY really made it a little bit... dataset track is I think tied with social good in whatever way so we kind of really want to discard random stuff. It has to be multimedia related data sets that are released for general purpose usage, right? Yeah, so we have to be really careful because there are gonna be lots of data set papers in a lot of ways. Yeah, well I mean independent problem. Independent of that is the is the hackathon, the current idea of the hackathon, and all the details are to be determined, is that given that we're anyway having this longer schedule of almost two weeks of multimedia gatherings around ACM Multimedia is that the weekend before, in parallel to MedEvo, there will be two days of hackathon if we can pull this off. And then the idea would be that after these two days there will be a hackathon results session at the main conference so people have the chance to work on this. They get the data beforehand because we will have to release the data beforehand anyway. They can work on some things. We can probably have a call for project proposals or something. Again, details to be determined. People can work on this for two days and then present their results. Ideally with the goal that any data augmentation that comes out of this is then also published as a companion data set to the main thing to be used for any future activities. So one thing that is also good to keep in mind this is going to be very broad data set like with lots of streams meaning just a single camera recording can be data set by itself so there may be kind of a danger that many spin-offs are gonna appear like and then it becomes really kind of hard to track that it came actually. This is exactly why we also need to set this up in a way to say, OK, these are all the augmented. But I mean, there's a genealogy of data sets. Whenever somebody releases a big thing, then you usually find people who build on this and say, oh, I just have this curated subset that is also precisely annotated, that doesn't introduce any new data, it just introduces new annotations and it has some quality criteria and things like that. Just, I meant we have to make sure that it's properly credited, you know, like because this is... Yes, but I mean this is the usual, this is exactly, we will need to have all of this traceable, all of this is supposed to be archival, and... The license is going to require people to reference the source. Yeah, so all of this builds and essentially just glows into a resource that is as useful as possible to as large a chunk of the community as we can because it has video it had audio it has sense streams it has interaction so it might even be useful for people outside of the core multimedia community and you've seen keynote innote in Iceland, like your colleague with the agents, teaching actually agents, and he was actually making a point that we don't do it right, basically. Yeah, so I mean, you can do human-machine interaction studies with this, you can even do communication studies with this, in case communication scientists find something useful in here, right? I have no idea. Group dynamics while cooking breakfast."

Just, I meant we have to make sure that it's properly credited, you know, like because this is... Yes, but I mean this is the usual, this is exactly, we will need to have all of this traceable, all of this is supposed to be archival, and... The license is going to require people to reference the source.

And then when people want to discuss this throughout the day, please do. And we will have another round tomorrow morning where we essentially gather the various things people came up with. And then go on from there and we have some more discussion points on hackathon things. The plan is about 90 minutes every morning of workshop. That should lead to a proposal for a grand challenge at ACM Multimedia and a proposal for a hackathon at ACM Multimedia. And the idea of what would happen for Castle 2. Wait a second, when you say hackathon at ACM Multimedia, we don't normally have hackathons. We have different formats of grand challenges. No, this is new. This is new. Came out of the ACM Next Steps Multimedia workshop that we have. And hackathon, would people start working on it before? Because some Grand Challenges have that form. This is independent. Like the social media. Two independent activities. So the format of the Grand Challenge is going to be the same as any Grand Challenge. It has a long-term schedule. We will release the dataset as soon as we are able able we will release the tasks as soon as we're able people can sign up people can download all the data they need they can work on it they will submit the results we will evaluate those submissions we will tell them how well they did they will submit their papers about... It would be really good to have a paper also ready before it yes there's some there will need to be a dataset paper oh but how are we gonna manage it before February March well the dataset paper will need to go out as a preprint and the final version of the dataset paper then goes out with a dataset track available to be determined. Yes, because we are also planning to have a dataset track newly created for 4.25. So it might go into the Grand Challenge track, details to be determined, but the preprint will definitely need to go out together with the dataset and also the challenge description independently of that. So for the dataset track we are gonna have to think really hard because SIGAY really made it a little bit... dataset track is I think tied with social good in whatever way so we kind of really want to discard random stuff. It has to be multimedia related data sets that are released for general purpose usage, right? Yeah, so we have to be really careful because there are gonna be lots of data set papers in a lot of ways. Yeah, well I mean independent problem. Independent of that is the is the hackathon, the current idea of the hackathon, and all the details are to be determined, is that given that we're anyway having this longer schedule of almost two weeks of multimedia gatherings around ACM Multimedia is that the weekend before, in parallel to MedEvo, there will be two days of hackathon if we can pull this off. And then the idea would be that after these two days there will be a hackathon results session at the main conference so people have the chance to work on this. They get the data beforehand because we will have to release the data beforehand anyway. They can work on some things. We can probably have a call for project proposals or something.

Leisure Activities,79,80," So if people actually want to look into the data, want to try things, want to play with it, this should be available starting tomorrow. And we're expecting around about 20 terabytes to be generated over the four days? Roughly. I mean, we will probably be able to re-encode this stuff more efficiently in the post-processing step, so we might be able to shrink it down quite a bit. I'm expecting that we will generate about roughly 20 terabytes of data across all the cameras during this week. The ultimate size of the final data set depends on a bunch of stuff. It's difficult to predict at this point in time. It will be several terabytes of data can I have one more thing to it before we get coffee and that is there are multiple tasks that you are able to do try to do every task okay game playing book reading on and on is reading experiment task Christmas tree making all these different things we want want to do cooking everybody has to cook everybody has to clean up after cooking twice right and these will be group activities so just engage and yeah the list of activities exist that's a written thing where that you can check we we should actually generate a new version of that yes it's not finalized becauseized because it keeps changing. We had various versions of this over time. It kept changing. What we also have is, again, some additional sensors. So we have the eye tracker, the semi-tracker tasks. That will, of course, not be perfectly time-aligned to everything because we only have one of them, so you can do the thing one at a time. We have some other cameras. I have a thermal camera somewhere so we can take some. Just some bits and pieces that can be added on. We have guitar. You must play some music at some stage. even if you can't play, let's make some noise."

I'm expecting that we will generate about roughly 20 terabytes of data across all the cameras during this week. The ultimate size of the final data set depends on a bunch of stuff. It's difficult to predict at this point in time. It will be several terabytes of data can I have one more thing to it before we get coffee and that is there are multiple tasks that you are able to do try to do every task okay game playing book reading on and on is reading experiment task Christmas tree making all these different things we want want to do cooking everybody has to cook everybody has to clean up after cooking twice right and these will be group activities so just engage and yeah the list of activities exist that's a written thing where that you can check we we should actually generate a new version of that yes it's not finalized becauseized because it keeps changing. We had various versions of this over time. It kept changing. What we also have is, again, some additional sensors. So we have the eye tracker, the semi-tracker tasks. That will, of course, not be perfectly time-aligned to everything because we only have one of them, so you can do the thing one at a time. We have some other cameras.

We can either boot Ubuntu or... One of them even might have an Ubuntu installed, otherwise we just get a new one. Yeah, but that's a good point because... If it's just for web, but... Exactly.

"The image depicts a scene that best fits the category of **Leisure Activities**.

Here's why:

*   **Christmas Decorations:** The presence of Christmas ornaments and a Christmas tree suggests a festive and relaxed occasion, which is typically associated with leisure.
*   **Gathering:** The arrangement of items on the table, such as ornaments and possibly gifts, implies people might be decorating or preparing for a holiday gathering.
*   **Casual Setting:** The overall environment appears to be a home setting, where leisure activities are commonly enjoyed.

While some elements might be related to other categories in a broader sense (e.g., setting a table for a meal), the primary activity implied by the visual cues is that of enjoying free time and engaging in holiday preparations.",1984,1988,

* **People interacting with the sink:** One person appears to be interacting with the sink area, and another is in the process of placing items into it.
* **Detergent and sponges:** While not explicitly clear, the presence of what appears to be dish soap and sponges in the sink area further supports this classification.
