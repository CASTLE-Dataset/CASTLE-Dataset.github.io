I do the pots of some kind of tomato based sauce. I do the. What are we actually doing here? And then freeze them in small 400 gram things,"
Meeting,91,1120," Yes. like yes yes yes yes yes uh aubergine for example and then you have mushrooms you have bacon that's it right right okay we're here we're good let's go let's go let's go let's go where is that oh my god you spend more time preparing the presentation than i spent can you take my ears off I do. It should be alright. No, it's off. No, hang on, wait, wait, wait. Castle. It's off. Castle. That's what you make for. It has people wearing cameras, look! That's also nice. So now you have to decide, right? Is this on? That's fine. I think this is generated by AI. Oh yeah, well some variation. Okay! Let's wait a second. My camera is in the way. Your time and date is also completely messed up. Oh, my time and date is messed up anyway. Oh, we were supposed to fix that. It didn't give me an option. Yeah, well, this is why we have the other dock. And also, now it's locked. Yeah, it didn't offer me the option to check it."
Using Laptop,1120,903," V3C2 data set. Plus we had the Marina video kit. I'm not sure if somebody of you knows how much hours are there, but I think tens or I think it was 1450 slide and again as much in the second slice. Is it 40? 14. 14. We're up to about 30ish with the addition that comes in this one. So this is the next, the final one here in 2025. We will have the MVK2 with this amount and then we have the full V3C collection with overall 3,801 hours. And we also have the medical data set, the laparoscopic hysterectomy with 100 hours. And yeah, think would be a great challenge in one month roughly so we may have in 2026 a lifestyle challenge as part of this right right right exactly so that could be another part for the vps where we look into these videos 400 hours 500 600 hours of content Right? That was. That? Hi, over the last four. 400 hours, right? Not quite as much. Fixed cameras as well, right? Yeah, sure, but it's only about, well, we'll go into the numbers in a bit. So that would be very nice challenges as well. And yeah, I think finally to conclude my part of the presentation, I think what we saw at the VPS is that currently all systems use state-of-the-art technologies like Clip and Blip and so on. But also there is some consistency within teams that the same team with different users performs similarly, which is good, I think. And the user interface interface is very important I think this is also a very unique aspect of the VPS it's not only let's say that the system behind but a lot is by the user interface and how you provide interaction possibilities. I feel nice to have kept the video browser. Yes, exactly. I think it's quite important. Exactly. Right, so that's it. So thank you very much. May I just short advertisement break in this point? If you think VBS is a cool thing to do and you haven't volunteered any judges from your team for E25, please let me know. Lin's going. Volunteer! Yeah, we'll be the ones here. You don't need to be there actually, judges can be remote as well. But if you're there, I'm going to let you in. You're going too? We can do it remotely, but what time? It's actually quite convenient for European time, because it's afternoon, so it gets into the morning in the morning. We can do it remotely. Andy, I will talk to Andy. He could be a good judge. Check with him and let me know. Okay, let's keep going. Remind me to remind Klaus to remind me to remind Klaus. I want to follow up with a short few slides about the LifeLock search challenge motivated by Gordon Bell's work on MyLifeBits. So Gordon Bell built a lifetime store and was built inside of a database. You could query through a nice interface. We want to take this into the community as well so over the past decade or so we've run a number of different challenges at NTCAR in Japan and Image Clay in Europe and one we're going to talk about today is the LSE Lifeblood Search Challenge kind of well really motivated by the video browser showdown challenge which was so successful and we're going to talk about that terms of growth, we started off with six teams in Yokohama in 2018, and most recently we had 21 participants in the most recent LifeLog Search Challenge, which took place just a couple of months ago in Phuket in Thailand. They're anchoring everything. So, LifeLog Day... A couple months ago is stretching into French territory, where you have the husband and the wife and the husband's mistress. It's a happy family. Yeah, exactly. Five months ago now. The dataset we have is not quite as large as the 3800 and one hour BBS dataset. It is an 18-month dataset from one person, an anonymous person. It contains wearable camera data from fixed image sequence wearable cameras, concept detectors, stuff like that. It contains some real camera phone photographs as well. Matched biometrics from monitors, heart rate sensors, et cetera, and watches. We did a bit of information access, but that's really problematic for privacy concerns and then activity detection annotations as well. So those datasets become reasonably large I think we ran to around about a million images give or take in these kind of datasets I really can't remember now 780,000 or something and we tend to look for images as answers, answers as answers to queries and they're the typical units of retrieval. So it's quite challenging, especially because you have to do anonymization. And with video data that's openly available online, you download the videos. With LifeLog data, you have all kinds of challenges related to faces and content on screens and phone content as you're using your phone, because this inevitably gets captured. So you have to come up a process where the LifeLog reviews and cleans their data. They share it with our researchers in the university. The researcher then checks to make sure that things are okay. And we resize all content to make sure text isn't necessarily legible. We then anonymize anyway the screens and the faces, and then we review it again and release the datasets. It takes quite a long time to do that, but then we even with that have strict access controls. If you sign up to use a lifeline dataset, you sign up to rules that says we can ask you to delete any image and you must do it, or delete the whole dataset. We haven't had to do that, but that's in there. Okay, so to have queries just as VBS has spoken about, we have known item, ad hoc, and Q&A queries. Known item queries"
Leisure Activities,903,2561," That's something like the sound of Hallelujah. So, see? That's G, that's C. Let me see this side. This one, this one, and this one. Yeah, this side.

So that's a change you might want to... if you think of it as an industrial setting, that's a change. If someone puts a pile of stuff there, that's what you want. So I'll do a Christmas tree. Ooh! Christmas tree? Where are we taking the Christmas tree? Yeah, right. Rappelgabri. Nice! Let's go! Rappelgab cooking. I'll do all the cooking. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

I really thought it was still not good enough. That sounds nice. Look, she can play guitar. No, I can't. You're playing? Yes. There's only two people who can play guitar. She's playing the piano. Oh, she can play the piano really well. No, I can't. She's like, I don't know. I don't know. Really good. Really good. Really good. Really good. That's not the title. The river runs through it. The river runs through it. The river runs through it. That's a perfect title. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of people who are coding things like barter splats. So you basically have to have those as a... Because there's a problem with having that kind of data as well. You get the data, and you have to have it. That's the's great. Well, it's really interesting. I think it's a good approach to make a nurse. A nurse will learn through your network. You might have your own experience. You basically do a point job. So you can give a job to tell Andrew who will probably need to do the most of the work. I picked a portion around the point. And then you alert the barometers so that you can start the sources that you have. So you get a bigger card. And then you can put this card in the card for weeks. With another castle. I just need a for weeks. With the lovely castle? From the castle. Malaheis. Malaheis is a lot more expensive. It was like 8,000 euros for a castle. Malaheis, by the way. You have to ride the entire castle to go. You have to take over by this path. Here it's great. Nothing is visible. It's just a... Change it to cattle bridge. And then we go to the farmhouse. Cattle, 25. They can play some happy ballad. Okay, there it comes. Just check it out. We can have a roll around. I think you need a set for a human-cow interaction. This is where it's like... To be fair, it will probably be the only video they can set for a human-cow interaction. Oh, this is great. To be fair, it will probably be the only video they've set for a human-cow interaction.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is for me. Actually, it's my fault. I kind of regretted it and put it in the fridge. We could have forgotten about it. But cooking took so long, so it's probably better to put it in the fridge. There's no cheese in... Yeah, put as much as you want. Oh, there's no cheese in the fridge. So it's not just garnish, it's actually an ingredient. That would be a great excuse to put extra cheese. It's not pure, maybe vegan. Why are you asking such stupid questions? It should be in the... in the... you know... Modular. Werner is thinking about everything. Are you sure the rest of the risotto is vegan? Is there no butter in there? Yeah, there is butter.
