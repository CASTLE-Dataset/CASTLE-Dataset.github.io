"The image shows a person who appears to be in a kitchen or dining area. There are cabinets, a clock on the wall, and a tray on a counter, suggesting a domestic setting. The person is looking away from the camera, and their attire (a grey shirt) doesn't provide clear clues. However, the presence of what appears to be food items and cooking utensils in the background, combined with the overall context of a kitchen environment, makes ""Cooking"" a plausible classification. It's also possible they are preparing to eat or serve food, but the visible elements lean more towards the preparation phase.

Hence, we end up in the end of the world, west of Ireland where nobody else exists."

Yes. Of an unnamed year. We will begin workshop and data set gathering. I don't see slides last night, Luca. Also, on the previous slide, you said, well, next year in 2025.

Meeting,708,907," Yes. So hopefully... Why are we wearing the same shirt man? When you become elderly person you buy this brand and then soon it becomes the same color even. Yeah I brought my ICMR one because I thought more people would have that and we get confused on camera. Yeah, So actually we think that this data set might be usable for the Live Vlog search change, but also maybe for the video browser showdown. So I will give a very short introduction what it actually is. So what is it? It's a live evaluation platform for interactive video search, which really performs large scale video content retrieval. and we have different types of queries I will give some examples and we have a competitive setup because we have not only large data set but we have also a lot of participants and yeah it's going for several hours it's also an entertaining event because it's connected to the welcome reception at the MMM conference every year. And so this is how it looks like. It started in 2012 in Klagenfurt and then we went every year to different places at the MMM conference. And what you can see here on the right, this is the last iteration in 2024. And next year we will continue this in January with 16 teams actually. And here we can also see that a lot of different teams from all around the world have participated in this competition. There are some very strong teams. One of them of course is from the University of Passau, one from Charles University in Prague and another one from Pisa. Yeah and a few more of course there are so many teams that I cannot mention them all. And the query types we have known item search where you know what you are looking for visually also textually the second one so that would be a visual example and it gives you to find this as fast as possible and only see this small clip and the texture one would be a description like a girl and a man run up"
Meeting,907,914," hardly imagine how it looked like. Yeah, and that would be the scene. Right, so we were going to see the flagpole. It's a Canadian flag. Right. Okay, now we have visual question answering. Somehow I did not have enough time. But we have the question answering like this. How many nights do we see passing in the video until this segment? I think this is very interesting because you also need the video playback functionality and quickly go over the video. And of course need to understand that the darkness outside could be an indication of how many nights you see in the video and we have um well if the if the license of the data set is okay, then this should be all Creative Commons licensed. It should be. Yeah, yeah, you never know. It should be. All of these videos are Creative Commons licensed. Exactly. But... We're relying on somebody else. Yes. Some of these people who made these videos are not entirely versed in the intricacies of licensing. So there may be... They're not all lawyers? Lukas talked to the lawyers too much. Okay, yeah. Anyway, so this is from v3c. Should be fine. And then we have ad hoc videooc video search where we need to find as many as possible items for a specific topic. And I don't have any examples for that, but Luca mentioned the dataset. Here we can see the different datasets that were used over the years. We started with only 30 videos, 38 hours. We went on to 100 hours and then ended up last year with 2300 hours from the v3c1 and v3c2 data set"

Is it 14? 14. I think we're up to about 30-ish with the addition that comes in. So this is the final one here in 2025, we will have the MVK2 with this amount, and then we have the full V3C collection with overall 3,100, 3,801 hours. Yes. And we also have the medical data set, the laparoscopic hysterectomy with 100 hours and yeah this I think would be a great challenge in one month roughly so we may have in 2026 a life-size challenge as part of this right right right exactly so that could be another party for you yes well we want to do 10 for 400 hours 500 600 was a content right there was yeah um high overlap 400 dollars not quite as much cameras as well right yeah sure but it's only about well we'll go into the numbers so that would be very nice challenges as well and uh yeah i think finally to conclude my part of the presentation, I think what we saw at the VPS is that currently all systems use state-of-the-art technologies like CLIP and PLIP and so on, but also there is some consistency within teams that the same team with different users perform similarly, which is good, I think think and the user interface is very important I think this is also a very unique aspect of the VPS it's not only let's say the system behind but a lot is by the user interface and how you provide interaction. I feel nice to have kept the video browser term. Yes, exactly. I think it's quite important. Right, so that's it, so thank you very much. May I just short advertisement break in this point? If you think VDS is a cool thing to do and you haven't volunteered any judges from your team for 25, please let me know. Lin's going. Volunteer! Well, you don't need to be there actually. Judges can be remote as well. But if you're there, yeah. You're going too, yes. You can do it remotely, but what's the problem? It's actually quite convenient for European time because it's afternoon. So it gets into the morning. Well, we can do it remotely. Andy, I would talk to Andy. He could be a good judge. Yeah. Check with him and let me know, please. Okay, let's keep going. Remind me to remind Klaus to remind me. I want to follow up with a short few slides about the LifeLock search challenge motivated by Gordon Bell's work on MyLifeBits. So Gordon Bell built a lifetime store and was built inside of a database. You could query through a nice interface. We want to take this into the community as well. So over the past decade or so, we've run a number of different challenges at NTCAR in Japan, MHCLAE in Europe. And the one we're going to talk about today is the LSE Lifeblood Search Challenge. Kind of, well, really motivated by the Video Browser Showdown Challenge, which was so successful. Hence, we're going to talk about that. In terms of growth, we started off with six teams in Yokohama in 2018 and most recently we had 21 participants in the most recent Lifehack Search Challenge which took place just a couple of months ago in Phuket in Thailand. They're angering everything. So Lifehack... A couple months ago is stretching into French territory where you have the husband and the wife and the husband's mistress. It's a happy family. Five months ago now. The dataset we have is not quite as large as the 3800 and one hour BBS dataset. It is an 18 month dataset from one person, an anonymous person. It contains wearable camera data from fixed image sequence wearable cameras, concept detectors, stuff like that. It contains some real camera phone photographs as well, matched biometrics from monitors, heart rate sensors, etc. and watches.

The other activities are not evident in the images.",1158,1437," plus we had the Marina video kit I'm not sure if somebody a few knows how much hours are there I think it was 1450 in the first slide and again as much in the second slice. Is it 14? 14. I think we're up to about 30-ish with the addition that comes in. So this is the final one here in 2025, we will have the MVK2 with this amount, and then we have the full V3C collection with overall 3,100, 3,801 hours. Yes. And we also have the medical data set, the laparoscopic hysterectomy with 100 hours and yeah this I think would be a great challenge in one month roughly so we may have in 2026 a life-size challenge as part of this right right right exactly so that could be another party for you yes well we want to do 10 for 400 hours 500 600 was a content right there was yeah um high overlap 400 dollars not quite as much cameras as well right yeah sure but it's only about well we'll go into the numbers so that would be very nice challenges as well and uh yeah i think finally to conclude my part of the presentation, I think what we saw at the VPS is that currently all systems use state-of-the-art technologies like CLIP and PLIP and so on, but also there is some consistency within teams that the same team with different users perform similarly, which is good, I think think and the user interface is very important I think this is also a very unique aspect of the VPS it's not only let's say the system behind but a lot is by the user interface and how you provide interaction. I feel nice to have kept the video browser term. Yes, exactly. I think it's quite important. Right, so that's it, so thank you very much. May I just short advertisement break in this point? If you think VDS is a cool thing to do and you haven't volunteered any judges from your team for 25, please let me know. Lin's going. Volunteer! Well, you don't need to be there actually. Judges can be remote as well. But if you're there, yeah. You're going too, yes. You can do it remotely, but what's the problem? It's actually quite convenient for European time because it's afternoon. So it gets into the morning. Well, we can do it remotely. Andy, I would talk to Andy. He could be a good judge. Yeah. Check with him and let me know, please. Okay, let's keep going. Remind me to remind Klaus to remind me. I want to follow up with a short few slides about the LifeLock search challenge motivated by Gordon Bell's work on MyLifeBits. So Gordon Bell built a lifetime store and was built inside of a database. You could query through a nice interface. We want to take this into the community as well. So over the past decade or so, we've run a number of different challenges at NTCAR in Japan, MHCLAE in Europe. And the one we're going to talk about today is the LSE Lifeblood Search Challenge. Kind of, well, really motivated by the Video Browser Showdown Challenge, which was so successful. Hence, we're going to talk about that. In terms of growth, we started off with six teams in Yokohama in 2018 and most recently we had 21 participants in the most recent Lifehack Search Challenge which took place just a couple of months ago in Phuket in Thailand. They're angering everything. So Lifehack... A couple months ago is stretching into French territory where you have the husband and the wife and the husband's mistress. It's a happy family. Five months ago now. The dataset we have is not quite as large as the 3800 and one hour BBS dataset. It is an 18 month dataset from one person, an anonymous person. It contains wearable camera data from fixed image sequence wearable cameras, concept detectors, stuff like that. It contains some real camera phone photographs as well, matched biometrics from monitors, heart rate sensors, etc. and watches. We did a bit of information access, but that's really problematic for privacy concerns."

That's what we're aiming for here. The issue with all of these data sets is that they're image sequence, two images a minute. We're trying to push beyond that now.

We're going to have Luca to tell us what we're doing and how we should do it properly and all the mistakes we're making that we shouldn't do. Okay, so I didn't have slides for this. This is more going to be a bit of a show and tell. So just to give you a bit of technical detail on how this all is actually working. I mean, you're already all wearing the cameras. But just so that you all are aware of what you actually have. These are GoPro Hero 10s. Yes. They are equipped with a 256 gigabyte SD card. and they're set to record it at Ultra HD 4K in 50 frames a second. Continuously. Sorry. Gesundheit! This gives us about 8 or so hours, depending on what's actually going on, of recording capacity per camera per day. These recordings are not necessarily continuous, you can interrupt them at any time whenever you're doing something that you may not want to be on the record, you can interrupt this at any time. Again, important, just pause the recording, do not turn off the camera, because if you turn off the camera it goes out of sync and all the timing issues and it might also then complain about starting up, it has some not enough power issues, because it's not actually from from the internal battery and just a hint also do not touch the touchscreen yes try not to touch the touchscreen because it is very swipey right you might accidentally change the mode or something so try to only use the top button also it is blinking whenever it is recording so I can now see when i look at all of you that all of your cameras are actually blinking so all of you will recording what i'm telling you um if you happen to see somebody walking around and the camera is not blinking um do let them know because that might not be intentional do you also have a feeling of this Strange Days cyberpunk movie from you remember that one 20 some years ago i don't know okay crazy movie we are not reasonable though right yeah i thought it would be weirder could be worse could be worse could be worse so um in order to facilitate this long-form recording, you are also all wearing pouches or other types of batteries. So this is a 20 amp hour battery. It has plenty of capacity to run this camera up until the SD card is full. We will recharge these every night as well. So every night data is copied off, you get the fresh SD card and the fully charged battery bank in the morning. In addition to the cameras you're wearing, there's some stationary cameras. There's one over there, there's one over there, and there's two more in this part of the house, and then one additional one in the other room. At least the four in here are set to record continuously for the entire day. So they should each record 12, 13 hours, depending on when exactly we stop for the day, to essentially anchor the activities of all the individual effects. What we will do afterwards is to ideally frame level align all these videos so they're perfectly synced in time, or at least as perfect as we can make them. We don't actually know the the clock drift of these cameras so we will have to see how what level of precision is actually achievable with this but this is going to be a post-processing problem. Maybe a good computer vision task actually for later. Yeah, I think there's going to be some interesting things. So there's going to be some pre-processing that we're doing. Stratis and these people, he got an ERC for this line of time, arrow of time type of tasks."

Leisure Activities,2828,3004," and then there are some things that we will facilitate for other people to do to it, and to ideally also augment it for future usage after its release. That's part of the hackathon. The other thing is part of the challenge, where we give them the dataset in whatever form it will be, and we give them a bunch of tasks that we know how to evaluate the correctness of. It's probably going to involve some sort of retrieval queries similar to what we we've seen with BDS and LSE, something like that, but not in an interactive fashion, because these grand challenges are, you get the task, you work on the task, you submit the results, we will evaluate the results, and we tell you how well you did. So it will certainly involve something along these lines. It might also involve some more complex analysis tasks that are a longer form aggregation across this sort of stuff. How many cups of coffee were drunk? A lot. A lot? Yeah. That kind of thing, right? That kind of way of thinking. Yeah. And then we will just need to figure out how exactly we want to phrase this, how we could possibly evaluate this, and under what procedures we expect this to happen. The interesting part is that the whole process will be somewhat self-documenting, because the whole process of setting up this challenge and defining the precise task of the challenge will be part of the dataset that will be used for the challenge. So people can get all the documentation they could possibly need because they can just watch us coming up with the details. So basically you just give a dataset and say the challenge is in the dataset. Yes. Essentially. Það er það sem éð þáttum að hljóða. Það er það sem við þáttum að hljóða.

And also the challenge description independently of that so people know what to do. So for the dataset track, we are going to have to think really hard because SIGCHI really made it a little bit… Dataset track is, I think, tied with social good in whatever way.

Independent of that is the hackathon. the current idea of the hackathon, and all of the details are to be determined, is that given that we're anyway having this longer schedule of almost two weeks of multimedia gatherings around ACM Multimedia is that the weekend before in parallel to MedEvo there will be two days of hackathon if we can pull this off and then the idea would be that after these two days there will be a hackathon results session at the main conference so people have the chance to work on this. They get the data beforehand because we will have to release the data beforehand anyway. They can work on some things. We can probably have a call for project proposals or something. It's again details to be determined. People can work on this for two days and then present their results."

That will of course perfectly time-aligned to everything because you only have one of them, so you can do the thing one at a time. We have some other cameras.

Yeah, so we have a whole bunch of stuff. We can use that for time alignment also? Yes. Yeah, at least you can sync it the same as something else, right? Yeah, exactly.

Yeah possibly, but I mean you can you have you have spatially distributed microphones here. This is also there's there's interesting things you can you can do with this.

I mean, we actually have a project which is about... You know what I mean? We do a Greek dance around the house. Yeah, exactly, We actually have a project which is about dynamicity in digital twins.

I mean you have a lot of people moving around that you want to get rid of, but then you have things like Luca placing a chair at one corner and it stays there for half a day yeah so that's a change you might want to if you think of it as an industrial setting that's a change if someone puts a pallet of stuff there hey but also for the stuff that uh case nook does they have this kepler vision uh spin-off uh that's his new endeavor since the last few years they have lots of actually projects now with uh homes like measuring if the people have fallen, if they are hydrated enough, how many glasses of water they took you know like...

So basically you capture things and you try to capture with sensors you have, no changes. And I think this is exactly what happens in the house. I mean you have a lot of people moving around that you want to get rid of, but then you have things like Luca placing a chair at one corner and it stays there for half a day yeah so that's a change you might want to if you think of it as an industrial setting that's a change if someone puts a pallet of stuff there hey but also for the stuff that uh case nook does they have this kepler vision uh spin-off uh that's his new endeavor since the last few years they have lots of actually projects now with uh homes like measuring if the people have fallen, if they are hydrated enough, how many glasses of water they took you know like...

I mean the other thing I've thought about is i mean there's now quite activities on on coding things like gorgeous flats so you could reconstruct gorgeous flats of different rooms and then have this as a because that's sugar there's sugar having dynamic data as well you get sugar i don't know dynamic data is This is quite difficult. So what are these? Zucker! like you see, the idea of three gaussian squads is you basically do a point cloud as a start and then you learn a gaussian around each point, on a distribution, and basically you learn the parameters so that you can reconstruct the stories that you have. I mean we have a lot of views of the scene. Oh that's... ah yeah, okay."

While there's no specific action indicating a particular leisure activity, the overall setting and the presence of decorative items suggest a domestic or personal space where leisure might take place. The man's attire and relaxed posture also contribute to this classification.",1258,1263,

*   **Overall Ambiance:** The lighting and the general tidiness of the visible areas contribute to a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere, typical of leisure time.

I think it's not an issue because it's this mountain range it's like pretty much Austria and Switzerland. He said the odds are extremely slim like next to none but basically if they would catch a Bosnian they might give them shit right okay i see i see but people go there to climb these mountains like just heuristically you know like we went legally into montenegro because as it happens this lake from where you start climbing maglic mountain is on a bosnian side and the highest peak is also on bosnian side but then you have another peak on the way to this peak of Bosnia you cross Montenegrin okay part of I think it's just like people count as I mean whoever wants to do tourism like if you want to see any of these nice lakes or so you are probably crossing borders there are probably some rangers there there are rangers yeah Iangers, yeah. I mean, they are monitoring state border, there are passages and all the roads, but like you go to mountain, it's wilderness. It's the lake on 1500 altitude. There is basically just one cottage for shepherds in the summer. Like that bring... and even that I am even not sure. So you have ships up there? Yeah, yeah, ship, yeah. So I am not sure actually where people from Montenegro or from Bosnia bring the ship there. Because, yeah, it's just like you have to start from lake.

Okay, ciao. They are crazy. Kahal absolutely said not to do that, but it's not gonna be easy to anonymize. No, it's not. I mean, you know these things of like, you also use data from city driving around. Yeah yeah yeah. In one project we anonymized license plates and now basically we are at the thing okay if someone goes by from the city every day and you have the car there probably anonymizing license plate is not enough. No no no no. You can still track that's the right car. But not only that you house numbers. Some people are sensitive about it. But the house number is, I mean, you know the house is there. I mean, it is not revealing any information that you would not have. In Amsterdam, it depends really what the chief privacy officer was. And we were getting often press. But I mean, if I have the geolocation, I have the house number. Yeah, I know that. I know that. Oh, man, let go there because what does anonymizing person means? Yeah so is it the head? Is it the entire person? Because of the VPS judging but you would be... I would be the baptismal. Exactly that's what I thought. Yeah, yeah. You couldn't be judged.

This is because the setting (living room with a sofa and what appears to be a Christmas tree) and the relaxed postures of some individuals suggest they are spending time together in a casual, enjoyable manner. The presence of food items on the table could also indicate snacking or a casual meal, which falls under leisure.

"Based on the visual cues in the image, the segment can be classified as **Cooking**.

Here's why:

*   **Apron:** The person in the foreground is wearing an apron, which is commonly worn during cooking to protect clothing from stains.
*   **Goggles:** The person is also wearing goggles, which could be used for safety during certain cooking tasks, like chopping onions or working with hot oil.
*   **Kitchen setting:** The background appears to be a kitchen, with cabinets and what looks like kitchen appliances.
*   **Focus on a task:** The person in the foreground seems to be actively engaged in a task, leaning over a surface.

While the other person is present, their posture and location don't definitively suggest any specific activity other than being in the same room. The primary indicators point towards the person in the apron actively cooking.",1923,1925," I have a feeling that something very stupid... You know, how did we end up, please explain me, in Europe?

"This image depicts a scene that can be classified as **Leisure Activities**.

Here's why:

*   **Christmas Tree:** The presence of a Christmas tree strongly suggests a holiday season, which is typically associated with leisure and family gatherings.
*   **Indoor Setting:** The interior of a home is visible, with windows, curtains, and what appears to be a ceiling light. This suggests a relaxed indoor environment.
*   **Implied Social Interaction:** Although not clearly visible, the framing of the shot and the presence of what seem to be people in the lower right corner (even if blurred) imply a social setting, common during leisure time.

While other activities might occur in such a setting, the visual cues most strongly point to people enjoying downtime and possibly celebrating.",1909,1911," Okay, why don't we replace the beef stew with a chicken hot pot?
