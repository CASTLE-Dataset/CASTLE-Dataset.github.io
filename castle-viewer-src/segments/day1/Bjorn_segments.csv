*   **Refrigerated Contents:** The images show items in what appears to be a refrigerator or a cooler, a common place to store food.
*   **Food Packaging:** We can see packaging that strongly suggests food items, like a tub of Philadelphia cream cheese and what look like bags of prepared food.
*   **Human Interaction:** A person's hand is visible, reaching into the storage area, which is consistent with the act of retrieving or arranging food for serving.

"The most fitting category for this scene is **Cooking**.

Here's why:

*   **Visible food preparation:** Several people are gathered around a table with various food items, bowls, and utensils, suggesting they are in the process of preparing food.
*   **Kitchen setting:** The environment is clearly a kitchen with appliances like a stove, coffee maker, and cabinets, which are typical for cooking activities.
*   **Action of individuals:** People are seen handling food and equipment, reinforcing the idea of cooking.",1443,1450," Nah, fair enough."

Is that the one that I think is cute? So, I'm with you, Luca, on the preference. On the preference? Yeah. I'm not saying it can't be done. I'm not saying it can't. There's a categorical reason to not do it. And there are people who... I'm just saying that if you have the option to do it and the option to not do it, I would prefer the latter. We had a long debate in Iceland about pineapples and pizza. Ah, yes, the age-old question. Yeah. And so the president is actually a foreign president now. Actually, he's a foreign president. He's's why he's the former president. Pretty much. Not quite. After the scandal they tried. And according to the Italian, he must call with different names, right? Exactly, it's not a pizza if it has pineapple, right? Whatever, but not pizza. Yeah, exactly. But actually I like it also. It's okay for me. But I cannot share it to my Italian friends. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, no, right, right, yeah, exactly, yes. For me it's okay, it's not a preference. I mean, it's quite like... Like there's Hawaiian pizza and it's okay. But we could've used the grease on that. I don't know. Not the color. I don't know. That's what I don't know. Here's the brick that's unsalted water. I told you we have tea. I told you we have hot water. Who wants tea? Nobody. Nobody drinks. Nobody wants tea. I'm not going to do a pot of tea. I would. Otherwise I have to drink it all myself.

Making Coffee,2999,3030," Nice. So, basically, like I said, I just looked for what would be a good puppy machine. I mean, if you have a former student who went all nerd and he bought something for like 3,000, 4,000 euros, you know set up of like a separate grinder with a really nice machine and so on so wasn't gonna go for that but but this one like first I put there was one that was what was like three three hundred euros cheaper but that one took about half a minute to get the steam going whereas this one is like two three seconds oh really yes yeah and so for me that was worth you know in the morning i'm not the most patient person like half a minute in the morning would be an eternity so and you have to do for every cup you have to wait half minute to get the steam, right? So if you're making coffee for a few people, it accumulates a little bit. So I went for this. Yeah, nice. So it was a Christmas present from your wife? No, I just bought it. I mean, it's mean I said because I started drinking coffee and I figured out this is what I could buy and then you know I was just paying too much for coffee I said oh shit I can make this myself and then so yeah so you know it's just investment. You know in Austria we all have these automatic machines also grinding the beans and then automatically... Okay, yes. But yeah, it's not of course like an expensive machine. No, I don't touch it. And there's also, I'm not used to drinking coffee as, like with food, because a latte is, for me it's almost like a dessert it's something you have after food then you right right so but before the breakfast food no no no no you said you first do the food and then yeah so i only did it because when i needed to empty the pot and then but and also because this is not a latte right i always drink coffee before. Yeah, I like it. It's not like a dessert. It's also a dessert for lunch if you have some coffee afterwards. But in the morning I typically start with coffee. So you start with coffee, right? So you wake up and go I need coffee All right, yes, yes, yes eventually Yeah, this breakfast looks scary Generally speaking Irish country, yeah, course. You will try it?

I planned to book a castle, but they became too expensive. So next year, if we get a bigger grant, we can go to a yeah hey castle proper okay we can have a brainstorm in my session there there is a there is a there or at least there was an acronym at some point i don't think anyone wrote it down but there's a conference called castle right yeah experiment castle experiment we talked about life castle yeah life it's it's Live logging experiment.

And we'll hopefully, in the course of the one hour or one hour and a half every day this week we actually spend in a formalized workshop setting to find the next steps in video life logging research okay and then if i have to support the community to grow and be more impactful that's why we're here okay so there's that there's a work element there's a day to come again and it should be a fun element this holiday too makes sense yes okay that's probably quite loud here i have a plan for castle 24 today third of december, isn't it 3rd of December? Yes. Of an unnamed year. We will begin workshop and dataset gathering. I wrote these slides last night, Luca, very late. Also, on the previous slide you said, well, next year in 2025. This one is Castle 24. Okay, we now know, okay, we can't change it now. Castle 24. It's the 24th edition of the Castle Workshop. So we're going to gather a data set which every participant engages in realistic and safe POV, life logging of everyday activities. Safe because we're not going out interacting with people. We're in our clothes and a closed environment. Rules we have to follow which Luke will run through with you include things like not wearing the cameras to the bathroom. Something like that. We just don't want to know. Wednesday the 4th, Thursday the 5th of December we continue to do what we're doing now. We'll have a large breakfast with Tinder gathering today set and continue to have our workshops. Friday 5th of December, you tend to finalise the plans for a Grand Challenge, chart the way forward for the research community, find the next steps for this group, what comes out of this, and then finalise the data gathering which will happen over the coming month or two because there's quite a lot of data, quite a lot of work done on that. And then on Saturday we go back home. So that's basically it. We have a social activity or two. We're going to the Smoked Salmon Factory. It is the only activity in this area. So enjoy that. It's the best activity. It's like the highlight of the area. It's 5km away. So it's not that far. That I believe is at 3.30pm on Friday. And on Friday night we have a banquet of sorts in Kiao's"

Leisure Activities,677,686, Why are we wearing the same shirt man? Alright.
Meeting,686,699," Yes, so hopefully the... Why are we wearing the same shirt man? When you become elderly person you buy this brand and then soon it becomes the same color. I brought my IC Marble because I thought more people would have it and we get confused on camera. up okay yeah so actually we think that this data set might be usable for the LiveLog search change but also maybe for the video browser showdown. So I will give a very short introduction what it actually is. So what is it? It's a live evaluation platform for interactive video search which really performs large-scale video content retrieval and we have different types of queries I will give some examples and we have a competitive setup because we have not only a large data set but we have also a lot of participants and yeah it's going for several hours it's also an entertaining event because it's connected to the welcome reception at the MMM conference every year. And so this is how it looks like. It started in 2012 in Klagenfurt and then we went every year to different places at the MMM conference. And what you can see here on the right, this is the last iteration in 2024. and next year we will continue this in january with 16 teams actually and here we can also see that a lot of different teams from all around the world have participated in this competition there are some very strong teams one of them of course is from the University of Basel, one from Charles University in Prague and another one from Pisa. Yeah, and a few more of course, there are so many teams that I cannot mention them all. And the query types, we have non-item search, where you know what you are looking for visually, also textually the second one so that would be a visual example and you need to find this as fast as possible and i only see this small clip and the texture one would be a description like a girl and a man run up a small hill. There is a flagpole with a Canadian flag on top. There are white green benches, a lamp post and stairs up the hill. The flagpole is on top of a stone structure with a cannon. This was a very challenging task actually. I could hardly imagine how it looked like. Yeah and that would be the scene right so we were going to see the flagpole it's a canadian flag right okay there we have visual question answering um somehow i did not have enough time. But we have a question answering. Excuses, excuses. How many nights do we see passing in the video until this segment? I think this is very interesting because you also need the video playback functionality and we can go over the video and of course you need to understand that the darkness outside could be an indication of how many nights you see in the video and we have not too much music if the license of the dataset is okay, then this should be... Yeah. Well, it should be. Yeah, yeah, you never know. It should be. All of these videos are Creative Commons licensed. But... We're relying on somebody else. Yes. Some of these people who make these videos are not entirely versed in the intricacies of licensing so there may be there's no lawyers there look has talked to lawyers too much okay yeah anyway so this is for me 3c should be fine and then we have a top video search where we need to find as many as possible items for a specific topic. And I don't have any example for that, but Luca mentioned the dataset. Here we can see the different datasets that were used over the years. We started with only 30 videos, 38 hours. We went on to 100 hours and then ended up last year with 2, hours from the V3C1 and V3C2 data set."

And the query types, we have non-item search, where you know what you are looking for visually, also textually the second one so that would be a visual example and you need to find this as fast as possible and i only see this small clip and the texture one would be a description like a girl and a man run up a small hill. There is a flagpole with a Canadian flag on top. There are white green benches, a lamp post and stairs up the hill. The flagpole is on top of a stone structure with a cannon. This was a very challenging task actually. I could hardly imagine how it looked like. Yeah and that would be the scene right so we were going to see the flagpole it's a canadian flag right okay there we have visual question answering um somehow i did not have enough time. But we have a question answering. Excuses, excuses. How many nights do we see passing in the video until this segment? I think this is very interesting because you also need the video playback functionality and we can go over the video and of course you need to understand that the darkness outside could be an indication of how many nights you see in the video and we have not too much music if the license of the dataset is okay, then this should be... Yeah. Well, it should be. Yeah, yeah, you never know. It should be. All of these videos are Creative Commons licensed. But... We're relying on somebody else. Yes. Some of these people who make these videos are not entirely versed in the intricacies of licensing so there may be there's no lawyers there look has talked to lawyers too much okay yeah anyway so this is for me 3c should be fine and then we have a top video search where we need to find as many as possible items for a specific topic. And I don't have any example for that, but Luca mentioned the dataset. Here we can see the different datasets that were used over the years. We started with only 30 videos, 38 hours. We went on to 100 hours and then ended up last year with 2, hours from the V3C1 and V3C2 data set."

Some of these people who make these videos are not entirely versed in the intricacies of licensing so there may be there's no lawyers there look has talked to lawyers too much okay yeah anyway so this is for me 3c should be fine and then we have a top video search where we need to find as many as possible items for a specific topic. And I don't have any example for that, but Luca mentioned the dataset. Here we can see the different datasets that were used over the years. We started with only 30 videos, 38 hours. We went on to 100 hours and then ended up last year with 2, hours from the V3C1 and V3C2 data set."
Meeting,928,931," Yes, so hopefully the... Why are we wearing the same shirt man? When you become elderly person you buy this brand and then soon it becomes the same color. I brought my IC Marble because I thought more people would have it and we get confused on camera. up okay yeah so actually we think that this data set might be usable for the LiveLog search change but also maybe for the video browser showdown. So I will give a very short introduction what it actually is. So what is it? It's a live evaluation platform for interactive video search which really performs large-scale video content retrieval and we have different types of queries I will give some examples and we have a competitive setup because we have not only a large data set but we have also a lot of participants and yeah it's going for several hours it's also an entertaining event because it's connected to the welcome reception at the MMM conference every year. And so this is how it looks like. It started in 2012 in Klagenfurt and then we went every year to different places at the MMM conference. And what you can see here on the right, this is the last iteration in 2024. and next year we will continue this in january with 16 teams actually and here we can also see that a lot of different teams from all around the world have participated in this competition there are some very strong teams one of them of course is from the University of Basel, one from Charles University in Prague and another one from Pisa. Yeah, and a few more of course, there are so many teams that I cannot mention them all. And the query types, we have non-item search, where you know what you are looking for visually, also textually the second one so that would be a visual example and you need to find this as fast as possible and i only see this small clip and the texture one would be a description like a girl and a man run up a small hill. There is a flagpole with a Canadian flag on top. There are white green benches, a lamp post and stairs up the hill. The flagpole is on top of a stone structure with a cannon. This was a very challenging task actually. I could hardly imagine how it looked like. Yeah and that would be the scene right so we were going to see the flagpole it's a canadian flag right okay there we have visual question answering um somehow i did not have enough time. But we have a question answering. Excuses, excuses. How many nights do we see passing in the video until this segment? I think this is very interesting because you also need the video playback functionality and we can go over the video and of course you need to understand that the darkness outside could be an indication of how many nights you see in the video and we have not too much music if the license of the dataset is okay, then this should be...

"The video segment falls into the **Meeting** category. 

Several individuals are gathered in a living room, with one person standing and addressing the group while others are seated, observing or listening. This suggests a structured gathering or discussion, characteristic of a meeting.",1131,1152," in one month roughly so we may have in 2026 a lifestyle challenge as part of this right right right exactly so that could be another part for the vps we are looking into these videos and for 400 hours 500 600 hours of content. There was 400 hours, right? Yeah, sure. But it's only about what we will go into. Yeah. So that would be very nice changes as well. And yeah, I think finally, to conclude my part of the presentation, I I think what we saw at the VPS is that currently all systems use state-of-the-art technologies like Clip and Blip and so on. But also there is some consistency within teams that the same team with different users perform similarly, which is good, I think. And the user interface is very important. I think this is also a very unique aspect of the VPS. It's not only let's say the system behind but a lot is by the user interface and how you provide interaction. Actually nice to have kept the video browser term. Yes. Yeah, because I think it's quite important. Right, so that's it, so thank you very much. May I just, short, short advertisement break in this point? Yes. If you think VDS is a cool thing to do and you haven't volunteered any judges from your team for 2025, please let me know. Lynn's going. Volunteer! Send mail to Andy. Andy would be a great judge. Yes, that would probably be okay to do it. It's quite convenient for European time. Please remind me. Yes. Well, Werner, Andy. You guys talk to Andy to get one. Check with him and let me know. Yes, yes. Remind me's keep going. Remind me to remind Klaus to ask Antti. I want to follow up with a short few slides about the LifeLock search challenge motivated by Gordon Bell's work on MyLifeBits. So Gordon Bell built a lifetime store and was built inside of a database. You could query through a nice interface. We want to take this into the community as well so over the past decade or so we've drawn a number of different challenges identity car in Japan image play in Europe and one more talk about today is the LSE lifeblood search challenge kind of well really motivated by the video browser showdown challenge which was so successful hence we'll talk about that in terms of growth we started off with six teams in yokohama in 2018 and most recently we had 21 participants in the most recent black cloud search challenge which took place just a couple of months ago in phuket and thailand a couple months ago is stretching into french territory where you have the husband and the wife and the husband's mistress and everything. Yeah, exactly. Five months ago now. The dataset we have is not quite as large as the 3,801-hour BBS dataset. It is an 18-month dataset from one person, an anonymous person. It contains wearable camera data from fixed image sequence wearable cameras, concept detectors, stuff like that. It contains some real camera phone photographs as well, matched biometrics from monitors, heart rate sensors, et cetera, and watches. We did a bit of information access, but that's problematic for um for privacy concerns and then activity activity detection annotations as well so those data sets become reasonably large i think we run to around about a million images give or take in these kind of data sets i really can't remember now 780 000 or something yeah um we tend to look for images as answers answers as answers to queries and they're the typical units of retrieval. So it's quite challenging especially because you have to do anonymization and with video data that's openly available online you download the videos. With lifelog data you have all kinds of challenges related to faces and content on screens and phone content as you're using your phone because this inevitably gets captured. So you have to come up with a process where the LifeLog reviews and cleans their data. They share it with our researchers in the university. The researcher then checks to make sure that things are okay and we resize all content to make sure text isn't necessarily legible. We then anonymize anyway the screens and the faces and then we review it again and release the datasets. It takes quite a long time to do that but then we we even with that have strict access controls. If you sign up to use the live data set, you sign up to rule that says we can ask you to delete any image and you must do it, or delete the whole data set. We haven't had to do that, but that's in there. Okay, so, to have queries just as VBS has spoken about, we have known item, ad hoc, and Q&A queries. Known item queries find a particular image of an event or activity that meets the information need. I'll look at an example of that. This was an example from two years ago. There was a man in the front row with a yellow hat on. I was on a stage in a room with a lot of people watching. I was on some sort of panel writing notes. I remember the man had a blue sweater on also it was in france and they said multimedia 2018. over the course of three minutes you get more detail given to you 19 19. was it yeah yes yes i can't read but that's an example of the picture that we have here um look ad hoc queries find all the examples of something important like find all the times I was taking medication or vitamins at home. Imagine a scenario where a physician cares about this. It would be impressive being alone. You want to clarify this kind of information. Or finding examples when I was wearing my yellow Happy Bee t-shirt. And it's a very nice t-shirt. Finally, Q&A. Most interestingly, this is what the real challenge is right now. Because we can kind of do finding content and even aggregation of finding content. Q&A, I visited a famous Korean temple with friends, actually some of them are here, a few years ago. What did I do immediately afterwards? We got a coffee. Tea. It was a tea shop. Oh, so you're anonymously in disd. They even bring you cheesecake. Oh yeah, it had matcha cheesecake. Actually, that is you. It might even be the same shirt. Different shirt, but it's you. I cannot fit into that. Another example. So much for anonymization, but I'm being sure. It's a blurred face, it's only recognizable to people who know him really well. Also is he wearing his name tag? No he's not. No, not on this one. Because this is from Seoul. By the shade you can even guess who's the second anonymous person. I was there I yes um there's at least three or four of us that were there okay second one damn it my car is a flat tire what was the name of the car service repair company i used in the summer of 2019 i want to call them again to get my car this is a real kind of challenge right what was the name of the company we went to a number of years ago and then even more complicated the one that nobody got right last year what airline did i fly most often with in 2019 real complex aggregation queries but that's what we're pushing for that's what we're aiming for here the issue with all of these data sets is that their image sequence two images a minute and we're trying to push beyond that now and then of course this led to what we think now is a standard lifeline search engine right which really focuses on visual embeddings multimodal"

If you sign up to use the live data set, you sign up to rule that says we can ask you to delete any image and you must do it, or delete the whole data set. We haven't had to do that, but that's in there. Okay, so, to have queries just as VBS has spoken about, we have known item, ad hoc, and Q&A queries. Known item queries find a particular image of an event or activity that meets the information need. I'll look at an example of that. This was an example from two years ago. There was a man in the front row with a yellow hat on. I was on a stage in a room with a lot of people watching. I was on some sort of panel writing notes. I remember the man had a blue sweater on also it was in france and they said multimedia 2018. over the course of three minutes you get more detail given to you 19 19. was it yeah yes yes i can't read but that's an example of the picture that we have here um look ad hoc queries find all the examples of something important like find all the times I was taking medication or vitamins at home. Imagine a scenario where a physician cares about this. It would be impressive being alone. You want to clarify this kind of information. Or finding examples when I was wearing my yellow Happy Bee t-shirt. And it's a very nice t-shirt. Finally, Q&A. Most interestingly, this is what the real challenge is right now. Because we can kind of do finding content and even aggregation of finding content. Q&A, I visited a famous Korean temple with friends, actually some of them are here, a few years ago. What did I do immediately afterwards? We got a coffee. Tea. It was a tea shop. Oh, so you're anonymously in disd. They even bring you cheesecake. Oh yeah, it had matcha cheesecake. Actually, that is you. It might even be the same shirt. Different shirt, but it's you. I cannot fit into that. Another example. So much for anonymization, but I'm being sure. It's a blurred face, it's only recognizable to people who know him really well. Also is he wearing his name tag? No he's not. No, not on this one. Because this is from Seoul. By the shade you can even guess who's the second anonymous person. I was there I yes um there's at least three or four of us that were there okay second one damn it my car is a flat tire what was the name of the car service repair company i used in the summer of 2019 i want to call them again to get my car this is a real kind of challenge right what was the name of the company we went to a number of years ago and then even more complicated the one that nobody got right last year what airline did i fly most often with in 2019 real complex aggregation queries but that's what we're pushing for that's what we're aiming for here the issue with all of these data sets is that their image sequence two images a minute and we're trying to push beyond that now and then of course this led to what we think now is a standard lifeline search engine right which really focuses on visual embeddings multimodal"
Discussing,1157,1165," in one month roughly so we may have in 2026 a lifestyle challenge as part of this right right right exactly so that could be another part for the vps we are looking into these videos and for 400 hours 500 600 hours of content. There was 400 hours, right? Yeah, sure. But it's only about what we will go into. Yeah. So that would be very nice changes as well. And yeah, I think finally, to conclude my part of the presentation, I I think what we saw at the VPS is that currently all systems use state-of-the-art technologies like Clip and Blip and so on. But also there is some consistency within teams that the same team with different users perform similarly, which is good, I think. And the user interface is very important. I think this is also a very unique aspect of the VPS. It's not only let's say the system behind but a lot is by the user interface and how you provide interaction. Actually nice to have kept the video browser term. Yes. Yeah, because I think it's quite important. Right, so that's it, so thank you very much. May I just, short, short advertisement break in this point? Yes. If you think VDS is a cool thing to do and you haven't volunteered any judges from your team for 2025, please let me know. Lynn's going. Volunteer! Send mail to Andy. Andy would be a great judge. Yes, that would probably be okay to do it. It's quite convenient for European time. Please remind me. Yes. Well, Werner, Andy. You guys talk to Andy to get one. Check with him and let me know. Yes, yes. Remind me's keep going. Remind me to remind Klaus to ask Antti. I want to follow up with a short few slides about the LifeLock search challenge motivated by Gordon Bell's work on MyLifeBits. So Gordon Bell built a lifetime store and was built inside of a database. You could query through a nice interface. We want to take this into the community as well so over the past decade or so we've drawn a number of different challenges identity car in Japan image play in Europe and one more talk about today is the LSE lifeblood search challenge kind of well really motivated by the video browser showdown challenge which was so successful hence we'll talk about that in terms of growth we started off with six teams in yokohama in 2018 and most recently we had 21 participants in the most recent black cloud search challenge which took place just a couple of months ago in phuket and thailand a couple months ago is stretching into french territory where you have the husband and the wife and the husband's mistress and everything. Yeah, exactly. Five months ago now. The dataset we have is not quite as large as the 3,801-hour BBS dataset. It is an 18-month dataset from one person, an anonymous person. It contains wearable camera data from fixed image sequence wearable cameras, concept detectors, stuff like that. It contains some real camera phone photographs as well, matched biometrics from monitors, heart rate sensors, et cetera, and watches. We did a bit of information access, but that's problematic for um for privacy concerns and then activity activity detection annotations as well so those data sets become reasonably large i think we run to around about a million images give or take in these kind of data sets i really can't remember now 780 000 or something yeah um we tend to look for images as answers answers as answers to queries and they're the typical units of retrieval. So it's quite challenging especially because you have to do anonymization and with video data that's openly available online you download the videos. With lifelog data you have all kinds of challenges related to faces and content on screens and phone content as you're using your phone because this inevitably gets captured. So you have to come up with a process where the LifeLog reviews and cleans their data. They share it with our researchers in the university. The researcher then checks to make sure that things are okay and we resize all content to make sure text isn't necessarily legible. We then anonymize anyway the screens and the faces and then we review it again and release the datasets. It takes quite a long time to do that but then we we even with that have strict access controls.

**Reasoning:** The individuals in the image appear to be engaged in a group activity in a living room setting.

I want to follow up with a short few slides about the LifeLock search challenge motivated by Gordon Bell's work on MyLifeBits. So Gordon Bell built a lifetime store and was built inside of a database. You could query through a nice interface. We want to take this into the community as well so over the past decade or so we've drawn a number of different challenges identity car in Japan image play in Europe and one more talk about today is the LSE lifeblood search challenge kind of well really motivated by the video browser showdown challenge which was so successful hence we'll talk about that in terms of growth we started off with six teams in yokohama in 2018 and most recently we had 21 participants in the most recent black cloud search challenge which took place just a couple of months ago in phuket and thailand a couple months ago is stretching into french territory where you have the husband and the wife and the husband's mistress and everything. Yeah, exactly. Five months ago now. The dataset we have is not quite as large as the 3,801-hour BBS dataset. It is an 18-month dataset from one person, an anonymous person. It contains wearable camera data from fixed image sequence wearable cameras, concept detectors, stuff like that. It contains some real camera phone photographs as well, matched biometrics from monitors, heart rate sensors, et cetera, and watches. We did a bit of information access, but that's problematic for um for privacy concerns and then activity activity detection annotations as well so those data sets become reasonably large i think we run to around about a million images give or take in these kind of data sets i really can't remember now 780 000 or something yeah um we tend to look for images as answers answers as answers to queries and they're the typical units of retrieval. So it's quite challenging especially because you have to do anonymization and with video data that's openly available online you download the videos. With lifelog data you have all kinds of challenges related to faces and content on screens and phone content as you're using your phone because this inevitably gets captured. So you have to come up with a process where the LifeLog reviews and cleans their data. They share it with our researchers in the university. The researcher then checks to make sure that things are okay and we resize all content to make sure text isn't necessarily legible. We then anonymize anyway the screens and the faces and then we review it again and release the datasets. It takes quite a long time to do that but then we we even with that have strict access controls. If you sign up to use the live data set, you sign up to rule that says we can ask you to delete any image and you must do it, or delete the whole data set. We haven't had to do that, but that's in there. Okay, so, to have queries just as VBS has spoken about, we have known item, ad hoc, and Q&A queries. Known item queries find a particular image of an event or activity that meets the information need. I'll look at an example of that. This was an example from two years ago. There was a man in the front row with a yellow hat on. I was on a stage in a room with a lot of people watching. I was on some sort of panel writing notes. I remember the man had a blue sweater on also it was in france and they said multimedia 2018. over the course of three minutes you get more detail given to you 19 19. was it yeah yes yes i can't read but that's an example of the picture that we have here um look ad hoc queries find all the examples of something important like find all the times I was taking medication or vitamins at home. Imagine a scenario where a physician cares about this. It would be impressive being alone. You want to clarify this kind of information. Or finding examples when I was wearing my yellow Happy Bee t-shirt. And it's a very nice t-shirt. Finally, Q&A. Most interestingly, this is what the real challenge is right now. Because we can kind of do finding content and even aggregation of finding content. Q&A, I visited a famous Korean temple with friends, actually some of them are here, a few years ago. What did I do immediately afterwards? We got a coffee. Tea. It was a tea shop. Oh, so you're anonymously in disd. They even bring you cheesecake. Oh yeah, it had matcha cheesecake. Actually, that is you. It might even be the same shirt. Different shirt, but it's you. I cannot fit into that. Another example. So much for anonymization, but I'm being sure. It's a blurred face, it's only recognizable to people who know him really well. Also is he wearing his name tag? No he's not. No, not on this one. Because this is from Seoul. By the shade you can even guess who's the second anonymous person. I was there I yes um there's at least three or four of us that were there okay second one damn it my car is a flat tire what was the name of the car service repair company i used in the summer of 2019 i want to call them again to get my car this is a real kind of challenge right what was the name of the company we went to a number of years ago and then even more complicated the one that nobody got right last year what airline did i fly most often with in 2019 real complex aggregation queries but that's what we're pushing for that's what we're aiming for here the issue with all of these data sets is that their image sequence two images a minute and we're trying to push beyond that now and then of course this led to what we think now is a standard lifeline search engine right which really focuses on visual embeddings multimodal"
Sitting,1195,1196," in one month roughly so we may have in 2026 a lifestyle challenge as part of this right right right exactly so that could be another part for the vps we are looking into these videos and for 400 hours 500 600 hours of content. There was 400 hours, right? Yeah, sure. But it's only about what we will go into. Yeah. So that would be very nice changes as well. And yeah, I think finally, to conclude my part of the presentation, I I think what we saw at the VPS is that currently all systems use state-of-the-art technologies like Clip and Blip and so on. But also there is some consistency within teams that the same team with different users perform similarly, which is good, I think. And the user interface is very important. I think this is also a very unique aspect of the VPS. It's not only let's say the system behind but a lot is by the user interface and how you provide interaction. Actually nice to have kept the video browser term. Yes. Yeah, because I think it's quite important. Right, so that's it, so thank you very much. May I just, short, short advertisement break in this point? Yes. If you think VDS is a cool thing to do and you haven't volunteered any judges from your team for 2025, please let me know. Lynn's going. Volunteer! Send mail to Andy. Andy would be a great judge. Yes, that would probably be okay to do it. It's quite convenient for European time. Please remind me. Yes. Well, Werner, Andy.

I was there I yes um there's at least three or four of us that were there okay second one damn it my car is a flat tire what was the name of the car service repair company i used in the summer of 2019 i want to call them again to get my car this is a real kind of challenge right what was the name of the company we went to a number of years ago and then even more complicated the one that nobody got right last year what airline did i fly most often with in 2019 real complex aggregation queries but that's what we're pushing for that's what we're aiming for here the issue with all of these data sets is that their image sequence two images a minute and we're trying to push beyond that now and then of course this led to what we think now is a standard lifeline search engine right which really focuses on visual embeddings multimodal"
Meeting,1274,1342," in one month roughly so we may have in 2026 a lifestyle challenge as part of this right right right exactly so that could be another part for the vps we are looking into these videos and for 400 hours 500 600 hours of content. There was 400 hours, right? Yeah, sure. But it's only about what we will go into. Yeah. So that would be very nice changes as well. And yeah, I think finally, to conclude my part of the presentation, I I think what we saw at the VPS is that currently all systems use state-of-the-art technologies like Clip and Blip and so on. But also there is some consistency within teams that the same team with different users perform similarly, which is good, I think. And the user interface is very important. I think this is also a very unique aspect of the VPS. It's not only let's say the system behind but a lot is by the user interface and how you provide interaction. Actually nice to have kept the video browser term. Yes. Yeah, because I think it's quite important. Right, so that's it, so thank you very much. May I just, short, short advertisement break in this point? Yes. If you think VDS is a cool thing to do and you haven't volunteered any judges from your team for 2025, please let me know. Lynn's going. Volunteer! Send mail to Andy. Andy would be a great judge. Yes, that would probably be okay to do it. It's quite convenient for European time. Please remind me. Yes. Well, Werner, Andy. You guys talk to Andy to get one. Check with him and let me know. Yes, yes. Remind me's keep going. Remind me to remind Klaus to ask Antti. I want to follow up with a short few slides about the LifeLock search challenge motivated by Gordon Bell's work on MyLifeBits. So Gordon Bell built a lifetime store and was built inside of a database. You could query through a nice interface. We want to take this into the community as well so over the past decade or so we've drawn a number of different challenges identity car in Japan image play in Europe and one more talk about today is the LSE lifeblood search challenge kind of well really motivated by the video browser showdown challenge which was so successful hence we'll talk about that in terms of growth we started off with six teams in yokohama in 2018 and most recently we had 21 participants in the most recent black cloud search challenge which took place just a couple of months ago in phuket and thailand a couple months ago is stretching into french territory where you have the husband and the wife and the husband's mistress and everything. Yeah, exactly. Five months ago now. The dataset we have is not quite as large as the 3,801-hour BBS dataset. It is an 18-month dataset from one person, an anonymous person. It contains wearable camera data from fixed image sequence wearable cameras, concept detectors, stuff like that. It contains some real camera phone photographs as well, matched biometrics from monitors, heart rate sensors, et cetera, and watches. We did a bit of information access, but that's problematic for um for privacy concerns and then activity activity detection annotations as well so those data sets become reasonably large i think we run to around about a million images give or take in these kind of data sets i really can't remember now 780 000 or something yeah um we tend to look for images as answers answers as answers to queries and they're the typical units of retrieval. So it's quite challenging especially because you have to do anonymization and with video data that's openly available online you download the videos. With lifelog data you have all kinds of challenges related to faces and content on screens and phone content as you're using your phone because this inevitably gets captured. So you have to come up with a process where the LifeLog reviews and cleans their data. They share it with our researchers in the university. The researcher then checks to make sure that things are okay and we resize all content to make sure text isn't necessarily legible. We then anonymize anyway the screens and the faces and then we review it again and release the datasets. It takes quite a long time to do that but then we we even with that have strict access controls. If you sign up to use the live data set, you sign up to rule that says we can ask you to delete any image and you must do it, or delete the whole data set. We haven't had to do that, but that's in there. Okay, so, to have queries just as VBS has spoken about, we have known item, ad hoc, and Q&A queries. Known item queries find a particular image of an event or activity that meets the information need. I'll look at an example of that. This was an example from two years ago. There was a man in the front row with a yellow hat on. I was on a stage in a room with a lot of people watching. I was on some sort of panel writing notes. I remember the man had a blue sweater on also it was in france and they said multimedia 2018. over the course of three minutes you get more detail given to you 19 19. was it yeah yes yes i can't read but that's an example of the picture that we have here um look ad hoc queries find all the examples of something important like find all the times I was taking medication or vitamins at home. Imagine a scenario where a physician cares about this. It would be impressive being alone. You want to clarify this kind of information. Or finding examples when I was wearing my yellow Happy Bee t-shirt. And it's a very nice t-shirt. Finally, Q&A. Most interestingly, this is what the real challenge is right now. Because we can kind of do finding content and even aggregation of finding content. Q&A, I visited a famous Korean temple with friends, actually some of them are here, a few years ago. What did I do immediately afterwards? We got a coffee. Tea. It was a tea shop. Oh, so you're anonymously in disd. They even bring you cheesecake. Oh yeah, it had matcha cheesecake. Actually, that is you. It might even be the same shirt. Different shirt, but it's you. I cannot fit into that. Another example. So much for anonymization, but I'm being sure. It's a blurred face, it's only recognizable to people who know him really well. Also is he wearing his name tag? No he's not. No, not on this one. Because this is from Seoul. By the shade you can even guess who's the second anonymous person.

We haven't had to do that, but that's in there. Okay, so, to have queries just as VBS has spoken about, we have known item, ad hoc, and Q&A queries. Known item queries find a particular image of an event or activity that meets the information need. I'll look at an example of that. This was an example from two years ago. There was a man in the front row with a yellow hat on. I was on a stage in a room with a lot of people watching. I was on some sort of panel writing notes. I remember the man had a blue sweater on also it was in france and they said multimedia 2018. over the course of three minutes you get more detail given to you 19 19. was it yeah yes yes i can't read but that's an example of the picture that we have here um look ad hoc queries find all the examples of something important like find all the times I was taking medication or vitamins at home. Imagine a scenario where a physician cares about this. It would be impressive being alone. You want to clarify this kind of information. Or finding examples when I was wearing my yellow Happy Bee t-shirt. And it's a very nice t-shirt. Finally, Q&A. Most interestingly, this is what the real challenge is right now. Because we can kind of do finding content and even aggregation of finding content. Q&A, I visited a famous Korean temple with friends, actually some of them are here, a few years ago. What did I do immediately afterwards? We got a coffee. Tea. It was a tea shop. Oh, so you're anonymously in disd. They even bring you cheesecake. Oh yeah, it had matcha cheesecake. Actually, that is you. It might even be the same shirt. Different shirt, but it's you. I cannot fit into that. Another example. So much for anonymization, but I'm being sure. It's a blurred face, it's only recognizable to people who know him really well. Also is he wearing his name tag? No he's not. No, not on this one. Because this is from Seoul. By the shade you can even guess who's the second anonymous person. I was there I yes um there's at least three or four of us that were there okay second one damn it my car is a flat tire what was the name of the car service repair company i used in the summer of 2019 i want to call them again to get my car this is a real kind of challenge right what was the name of the company we went to a number of years ago and then even more complicated the one that nobody got right last year what airline did i fly most often with in 2019 real complex aggregation queries but that's what we're pushing for that's what we're aiming for here the issue with all of these data sets is that their image sequence two images a minute and we're trying to push beyond that now and then of course this led to what we think now is a standard lifeline search engine right which really focuses on visual embeddings multimodal"
"This segment falls into the **Meeting** category. 

Here's why:

* **Presentation:** There's a person standing and seemingly presenting information on a screen, which is a common element of meetings.
* **Audience:** A group of people are seated, attentively watching the presenter, indicating they are gathered for a specific purpose.
* **Formal Setup:** The arrangement of people and the presentation suggest a more formal gathering than casual leisure.",1484,1531," in one month roughly so we may have in 2026 a lifestyle challenge as part of this right right right exactly so that could be another part for the vps we are looking into these videos and for 400 hours 500 600 hours of content. There was 400 hours, right? Yeah, sure. But it's only about what we will go into. Yeah. So that would be very nice changes as well. And yeah, I think finally, to conclude my part of the presentation, I I think what we saw at the VPS is that currently all systems use state-of-the-art technologies like Clip and Blip and so on. But also there is some consistency within teams that the same team with different users perform similarly, which is good, I think. And the user interface is very important. I think this is also a very unique aspect of the VPS. It's not only let's say the system behind but a lot is by the user interface and how you provide interaction. Actually nice to have kept the video browser term. Yes. Yeah, because I think it's quite important. Right, so that's it, so thank you very much. May I just, short, short advertisement break in this point? Yes. If you think VDS is a cool thing to do and you haven't volunteered any judges from your team for 2025, please let me know. Lynn's going. Volunteer! Send mail to Andy. Andy would be a great judge. Yes, that would probably be okay to do it. It's quite convenient for European time. Please remind me. Yes. Well, Werner, Andy. You guys talk to Andy to get one. Check with him and let me know. Yes, yes. Remind me's keep going. Remind me to remind Klaus to ask Antti. I want to follow up with a short few slides about the LifeLock search challenge motivated by Gordon Bell's work on MyLifeBits. So Gordon Bell built a lifetime store and was built inside of a database. You could query through a nice interface. We want to take this into the community as well so over the past decade or so we've drawn a number of different challenges identity car in Japan image play in Europe and one more talk about today is the LSE lifeblood search challenge kind of well really motivated by the video browser showdown challenge which was so successful hence we'll talk about that in terms of growth we started off with six teams in yokohama in 2018 and most recently we had 21 participants in the most recent black cloud search challenge which took place just a couple of months ago in phuket and thailand a couple months ago is stretching into french territory where you have the husband and the wife and the husband's mistress and everything. Yeah, exactly. Five months ago now. The dataset we have is not quite as large as the 3,801-hour BBS dataset. It is an 18-month dataset from one person, an anonymous person. It contains wearable camera data from fixed image sequence wearable cameras, concept detectors, stuff like that. It contains some real camera phone photographs as well, matched biometrics from monitors, heart rate sensors, et cetera, and watches. We did a bit of information access, but that's problematic for um for privacy concerns and then activity activity detection annotations as well so those data sets become reasonably large i think we run to around about a million images give or take in these kind of data sets i really can't remember now 780 000 or something yeah um we tend to look for images as answers answers as answers to queries and they're the typical units of retrieval. So it's quite challenging especially because you have to do anonymization and with video data that's openly available online you download the videos. With lifelog data you have all kinds of challenges related to faces and content on screens and phone content as you're using your phone because this inevitably gets captured. So you have to come up with a process where the LifeLog reviews and cleans their data. They share it with our researchers in the university. The researcher then checks to make sure that things are okay and we resize all content to make sure text isn't necessarily legible. We then anonymize anyway the screens and the faces and then we review it again and release the datasets. It takes quite a long time to do that but then we we even with that have strict access controls. If you sign up to use the live data set, you sign up to rule that says we can ask you to delete any image and you must do it, or delete the whole data set. We haven't had to do that, but that's in there. Okay, so, to have queries just as VBS has spoken about, we have known item, ad hoc, and Q&A queries.

"The image shows a person sitting on a chair. Therefore, the classification is **Sitting**.",1531,1533," you can have a look at that certainly and then I'll'll just say thank you, and let's kick off the workshop. Thank you. Let's go. We're gonna have Luca to tell us what we're doing and how we should do it properly. Yes. And all the mistakes we're making that we shouldn't do. Okay, so I didn't have slides for this, this is more gonna be a bit of a show and tell. So just to give you a bit of technical detail on how this all is actually working. I mean, you're already all wearing the cameras, but just so that you all are aware of what you actually have. These are GoPro Hero 10s. Yes. They're equipped with a 256 gigabyte SD card, and they're set to record at Ultra HD 4K in 50 frames a second. Continuously. This gives us about eight or so hours, depending on what's actually going on, of recording capacity per camera per day. These recordings are not necessarily continuous. You can interrupt them at any time. Whenever you're doing something that you may not want to be on the record, you can interrupt this at any time. Again, important, just pause the recording, do not turn off the camera, because if you turn off the camera, it goes out of sync and all the timing issues, and it might also then complain about starting up, it has some not enough power issues, because it's not actually powered from the internal battery. Just a hint also, do not touch the touchscreen. Yes, try not to touch the touchscreen because it is very swipey, right? You might accidentally change the mode or something. So try to only use the top button. Also, it is blinking whenever it is recording. So I can now see when I look look at all of you, that all of your cameras are actually blinking, so all of you are recording what I'm telling you. If you happen to see somebody walking around and the camera is not blinking, do let them know, because that might not be intentional. Do you also have a feeling of this Strange Days cyberpunk movie? Do you remember that one, 20-some years ago? I don't know. I didn't see it either. Okay, crazy movie. We are like reasonable now, right? Yeah. I thought it would be weirder. Could be worse. So, in order to facilitate this long-form recording, you are also all wearing pouches or other types of batteries. So this is a 20-amp hour battery. It has plenty of capacity to run this camera until the SD card is full. We will recharge these every night as well. So every night, data is copied off, you get the fresh SD card and the fully charged battery back in the morning. In addition to the cameras you're all wearing, there's some stationary cameras. There's one over there, there's one over there, and there's two more in this part of the house, and then one additional one in the other room. At least the four in here are set to record continuously for the entire day, so they should each record 12, 13 hours depending on when exactly we stop for the day To essentially anchor the activities of all the individual things What we will do Afterwards is to ideally frame level align all these videos So they're perfectly synced in time or at least as perfect"

Meeting,1770,1828," Yeah, there's going to be some interesting things. So there's going to be some pre-processing that we're doing. Stratis and these people, he got an ERC for this line of time, arrow of time type of tasks. Time alignment task is interesting. Yeah, but the time alignment will probably need to happen before we actually release this. There's a bunch of things that... So, essentially a series of tasks. We will generate the raw data with the sensors and with some more sensors that I'm going into in a minute."
Meeting,1828,1832," And then there's essentially multiple stages, right? There will be some processing on this"

Discussing,1838,1841," that needs to happen before we release this, just in order to say, okay, this is the data set, this is all the data augmentation you already did, this is what you can work with."
"The most fitting category for this segment is **Meeting**.

Here's why:

*   **Central Speaker:** There's a person standing and actively addressing a group of people.
*   **Audience:** The others are seated and appear to be listening or observing.
*   **Environment:** The setting looks like a common room, which is often used for informal meetings or gatherings.
*   **Interaction:** The body language suggests an exchange of information or a presentation.",1841,1894," And then afterwards, we have two parallel streams in activities that are already set up to happen next year. One being the challenge and the other being the hackathon. And we'll go into this in a bit. But especially also the hackathon will be able to do more data augmentation. So this is also something that we will have to think about,"
Meeting,1894,1914," we have two clocks that are set up to be machine readable. So every time you start your recording, I would ask you to go and have a look at the clock, because that will help us figure out when exactly in time your recording was. Because the wall clock time in these devices is not the greatest. It is not super precise. Even if you set it as precisely as you can, at least with the manual interface, it will be set to the minute. And with 50 frames a second, there's still a lot of frames that you might be out. So the machine readable clock with the QR code updates roughly five times a second. So this gives us a much more precise window to actually align these things. So ideally we should turn on the cameras in front of the clock? You should probably turn on the camera in front of a mirror, just to make sure that it's pointing roughly where you expect it to point. We have a bunch of mirrors around here. And then once you did that, go and visit the clock soonish, because then we can have an automated process that essentially always at the start of the video starts to look for the clock and then computes back when the start frame of that recording actually happened in time relative to the clock. And all the clocks in this house, the physical real clocks, all show different times. Yeah, so don't... We tried to correct two of them, so there's two that... This one is not too bad. Kind of too bad yeah do not rely on any other clock so the the the qr code clock is is what we considered true winding up that one but it's too good this one is is right exactly two times a day um there's there's some some clocks This one is reasonable. Yeah, I said that one. There are some clocks in here that are never right."

Discussing,1922,1926," we have two clocks that are set up to be machine readable. So every time you start your recording, I would ask you to go and have a look at the clock, because that will help us figure out when exactly in time your recording was. Because the wall clock time in these devices is not the greatest. It is not super precise. Even if you set it as precisely as you can, at least with the manual interface, it will be set to the minute. And with 50 frames a second, there's still a lot of frames that you might be out. So the machine readable clock with the QR code updates roughly five times a second. So this gives us a much more precise window to actually align these things. So ideally we should turn on the cameras in front of the clock? You should probably turn on the camera in front of a mirror, just to make sure that it's pointing roughly where you expect it to point. We have a bunch of mirrors around here. And then once you did that, go and visit the clock soonish, because then we can have an automated process that essentially always at the start of the video starts to look for the clock and then computes back when the start frame of that recording actually happened in time relative to the clock. And all the clocks in this house, the physical real clocks, all show different times. Yeah, so don't... We tried to correct two of them, so there's two that... This one is not too bad.

Preparing means because you said the substantial annotation is going to happen. Yes, so this is some of the, well the details are also to be discussed here. What is happening or what definitely will need to happen is the precise time alignment of all the streams. They will be encoded in a common structure, in a common format, so you will probably have videos that are all structured in a way that, for example, all the individual video chunks are exactly one hour long, they always start on the hour in case there's no recording, there's some insert that says this was camera number five, this was the time, but there's no video data available for that segment, something like this. And they're all time aligned. So you have camera one, hour one, day one, and so on and so forth, just in a collection of video files. The exact format to be determined, but something like this. So all of them are aligned. Then we're going to have to do some data augmentation, things that we already know that we would want anyway. So essentially run this through a state-of-the-art auto transcription system and then afterwards have people look at the transcripts and fix some things that the system might have gotten wrong, just to have a ground truth that is of reasonably high quality, especially since this might also be slightly multilingual. I mean, we will have the workshop activities in English, where we have people from all over, some of them speak different languages, so we might even have some conversations in different languages in the dataset, which is also interesting for the whole thing, just to make sure that all this annotation stuff is proper. What these things are also recording are streams of metadata. So these cameras have a 6 degrees of freedom IMU, so they will record at about 200 Hertz which direction down is, how these things would accelerate all the time, what direction it was looking in. It has a magnetometer, it has GPS. So whenever it takes some measurements, it knows where it was in space. So this can also be used to reconstruct some trajectories or to do some other interesting things. We will try to preserve this data as much as possible throughout all the processing steps, which is going to be a bit tedious, but we will figure out how to do this properly.

They are recording your heart rate, they are recording your blood oxygenation, I think. Some basic activities. And they're recording some step counting things at the very least. It's like an additional data set, right? I'm not sure if they do temperature. I'm not... Well, they record a bunch of things. It's not yet entirely clear what we can actually get out of these, in what format. But at least heart rate and some activity streams and possibly blood oxygenation over time should be possible. Again, they are very coarse. This is also something that we might want to think about for any future activities. This is a latter activity in the workshop. It may be possible. Be careful what you do and what you say. As Stefan said, it may be possible for us to take something out. But let's say we have to take out what happened right now because Karl said something crazy to get himself fired. We'd have to take the data out of all cameras at that point in time. So it's a big deal to do that. So we try to avoid that as much as possible. Yeah. In that sense, also, you may want to leave your smartphones in your rooms. Recognized. Because if you happen to get an email that has sensitive information in the subject line and you look at your phone and there's stuff that is, oh, this cannot be released because it might violate the privacy of external people, that would then need to be taken away. So this is definitely... And there are 4K cameras all around you. They're quite detailed in what they can do. So assume any text you're looking at can be read so any text that you that you realize cannot be shared with the outside world we need to make a note of this and this is part of the of the processing that we will need to do before this goes out that we need to cut this out and you don't want to you don't want to go back to yourself and think oh didn't I say something on the first morning and then try to find us we try divide cut this out.

No, I mean, the whole point of this is to actually release the data with as few access restrictions as we can make it, to make it as useful as possible to as many people as possible. so ideally, we would want to publicly release this thing under a Creative Commons, ideally CC BY license, and then just say, look, here's the thing, have at it. And then people can use it for whatever... Unless Google wants it, they have to pay. They have to sponsor upcoming activities. At least three for young people. We'll see about the exact details of the release of this thing. This is the plan. There are some things that we will do to it before we release it, and then there are some things that we will facilitate for other people to do to it, and to ideally also augment it for future usage after its release. That's part of the hackathon. The other thing is part of the challenge, where we give them the dataset, in whatever form it will be, and we give them a bunch of tasks that we know how to evaluate the correctness of. It's probably going to involve some sort of retrieval queries, similar to what what we've seen with VBS and LLC, something like that,"
Discussing,2763,2826," but not in an interactive fashion, because these grand challenges are you get the task, you work on the task, you submit the results, we will evaluate the results and we tell you what we did. So it will certainly involve something along these lines. It might also involve some more complex analysis tasks that are a longer form aggregation across this sort of stuff. How many cups of coffee were drunk? A lot. A lot. Yeah. That kind of thing, that kind of way of thinking. Yeah. And then we will just need to figure out how exactly we want to phrase this, how we could possibly implement this, and under what procedures we expect this to happen. The interesting part is that the whole process will be somewhat self-documenting, because the whole process of setting up this challenge and defining the precise task of the challenge will be part of the data set that will be used for the challenge.

So basically you just give out data sets and say that charlotte is in the data set yes"
"The image shows a group of people in a living room, some of whom are wearing headbands. They appear to be engaged in a shared activity, possibly a game or a presentation. Based on the context and the general atmosphere, the most appropriate classification is **Leisure Activities**.",2826,2828," but not in an interactive fashion, because these grand challenges are you get the task, you work on the task, you submit the results, we will evaluate the results and we tell you what we did. So it will certainly involve something along these lines. It might also involve some more complex analysis tasks that are a longer form aggregation across this sort of stuff. How many cups of coffee were drunk? A lot. A lot. Yeah. That kind of thing, that kind of way of thinking. Yeah. And then we will just need to figure out how exactly we want to phrase this, how we could possibly implement this, and under what procedures we expect this to happen. The interesting part is that the whole process will be somewhat self-documenting, because the whole process of setting up this challenge and defining the precise task of the challenge will be part of the data set that will be used for the challenge. So people can get all the documentation they could possibly need because they can just watch us coming up with the details. So basically you just give out data sets and say that charlotte is in the data set yes"
Meeting,2828,2890," essentially yes right um find the time we came up with this particular field yeah well you just find the query in the data set and then uh then solve the query yes I think this is really amazing also for this uh i i would say it's not new we've always wanted to go uh fully i would say unsupervised with everything and supervision can only get it there but we have so much data now and even overlapping streams i think this is going to be super kind of interesting for self-supervised folks and uh yes and i mean this is only the first step right because this is all off-the-shelf hardware so what what is also um an intent of this of this workshop here is to think beyond what we're currently able to do what's the next workshop and see if if we had infinite budget in infinite time, what would we want to do? And then essentially boil this down to given that we are presumably not going to have infinite budget in infinite time, what will we be actually able to do if we plan for doing this again in a year or two years? So I think maybe even more ambitious goal would be in order because you remember the first session at AC Multimedia, they were talking about a future and about multimedia agents and so on. I think maybe we have to even think, hey not in terms of how do we want, actually that's what they would like us to think about, how would we like the entire field to doing at least with regard to one of these lines that's what the hackathon conversation at AC Multimedia was about that was a particular innovation workshop where the hackathon came out of that was all about the future challenges not only this workshop but kind of in. But all of this hinges on actually having concrete material to work with. And this is going to be one set of data. And this has properties that will be unique among the available data sets, because this is not going to be the first POV activity data set. There are a handful of these and they have been studied quite a bit. But all of these have the limitation that they're either long-form activities in a very confined environment, or that they're very diverse activities in diverse environments that are completely disjointed, so you just have a few recordings, a few minutes, some person doing something and then this is gone and you never know what happened before or what happened after. Usually this is also happening in public, therefore it's heavily anonymized. are never having people time to move look it's taking longer I think we need to get coffee soon we need to get coffee there's going to be coffee we will hopefully not run out of coffee but then again we might also might also be able to do things like, when did I have coffee? Predict this solely based on my heart rate, right? Things like that. It's going to be epic. Long ago. Yeah. So again, the thing is, this will have overlap with types of data that exist. So we will also be able to take inspirations on the kind of tasks that people have been doing with other types of data that has the overlapping aspects. But this is going to have aspects that do not exist because we have many people in the same environment interacting with each other and with the environment. And we have the first-person view of all of these features. So this is something that is unique, that is not currently possible to do with any of these datasets that exist. So this will allow us to do new things. And the whole point of this and also of day one today is to start discussion on what all these things that we could leverage this for might be. So ideally, and what the agenda says, that we essentially threw out of the window because we started on our leg, is to today start this brainstorming, this ideation process jointly. And then when people want to discuss this throughout the day, please do. And we will have another round tomorrow morning where we essentially gather the various things people came up with. And then go on from there and we have some more discussion points on hackathon-y things. The plan is about 90 minutes every morning of workshop that should lead to a proposal for a grand challenge of AC Multimedia and a proposal for a hackathon in ACM Multimedia and the idea of what would happen for Castle 2. Wait a second, when you say hackathon in ACM Multimedia we don't normally have hackathons. We have different formats of grand challenges. This is new. This is new out of the ACM steps multimedia workshop that we have. And hackathon would people start working on it before? Because some grand challenges have that form. This is independent, two independent activities. So the format of the grand challenge is going to be the same as any grand challenge. It has a long-term schedule. We will release the data set as soon as we are able, we will release the tasks as soon as we're able, people can sign up, people can download all the data they need, they can work on it, they will submit the results, we will evaluate those submissions, we will tell them how well they did, they will submit their papers about... It would be really good to have a paper also really before that yes there will be there will need to be a data set paper oh but how are we going to manage it before february march well with the the data set paper will need to go out as a pre-print um and the the final version of the data set paper then goes out with actually in a data set tracker basically yes because because we are also planning to have a dataset track you newly created for smart 25 so it might see go it might go into the into the grand challenge track details to be determined but the preprint will definitely need to go out together with the dataset"

I think maybe we have to even think, hey not in terms of how do we want, actually that's what they would like us to think about, how would we like the entire field to doing at least with regard to one of these lines that's what the hackathon conversation at AC Multimedia was about that was a particular innovation workshop where the hackathon came out of that was all about the future challenges not only this workshop but kind of in. But all of this hinges on actually having concrete material to work with. And this is going to be one set of data. And this has properties that will be unique among the available data sets, because this is not going to be the first POV activity data set. There are a handful of these and they have been studied quite a bit. But all of these have the limitation that they're either long-form activities in a very confined environment, or that they're very diverse activities in diverse environments that are completely disjointed, so you just have a few recordings, a few minutes, some person doing something and then this is gone and you never know what happened before or what happened after. Usually this is also happening in public, therefore it's heavily anonymized. are never having people time to move look it's taking longer I think we need to get coffee soon we need to get coffee there's going to be coffee we will hopefully not run out of coffee but then again we might also might also be able to do things like, when did I have coffee? Predict this solely based on my heart rate, right? Things like that. It's going to be epic. Long ago. Yeah. So again, the thing is, this will have overlap with types of data that exist. So we will also be able to take inspirations on the kind of tasks that people have been doing with other types of data that has the overlapping aspects. But this is going to have aspects that do not exist because we have many people in the same environment interacting with each other and with the environment. And we have the first-person view of all of these features. So this is something that is unique, that is not currently possible to do with any of these datasets that exist. So this will allow us to do new things. And the whole point of this and also of day one today is to start discussion on what all these things that we could leverage this for might be. So ideally, and what the agenda says, that we essentially threw out of the window because we started on our leg, is to today start this brainstorming, this ideation process jointly. And then when people want to discuss this throughout the day, please do. And we will have another round tomorrow morning where we essentially gather the various things people came up with. And then go on from there and we have some more discussion points on hackathon-y things. The plan is about 90 minutes every morning of workshop that should lead to a proposal for a grand challenge of AC Multimedia and a proposal for a hackathon in ACM Multimedia and the idea of what would happen for Castle 2. Wait a second, when you say hackathon in ACM Multimedia we don't normally have hackathons. We have different formats of grand challenges. This is new. This is new out of the ACM steps multimedia workshop that we have. And hackathon would people start working on it before? Because some grand challenges have that form. This is independent, two independent activities. So the format of the grand challenge is going to be the same as any grand challenge. It has a long-term schedule. We will release the data set as soon as we are able, we will release the tasks as soon as we're able, people can sign up, people can download all the data they need, they can work on it, they will submit the results, we will evaluate those submissions, we will tell them how well they did, they will submit their papers about... It would be really good to have a paper also really before that yes there will be there will need to be a data set paper oh but how are we going to manage it before february march well with the the data set paper will need to go out as a pre-print um and the the final version of the data set paper then goes out with actually in a data set tracker basically yes because because we are also planning to have a dataset track you newly created for smart 25 so it might see go it might go into the into the grand challenge track details to be determined but the preprint will definitely need to go out together with the dataset"
Leisure Activities,3018,58," essentially yes right um find the time we came up with this particular field yeah well you just find the query in the data set and then uh then solve the query yes I think this is really amazing also for this uh i i would say it's not new we've always wanted to go uh fully i would say unsupervised with everything and supervision can only get it there but we have so much data now and even overlapping streams i think this is going to be super kind of interesting for self-supervised folks and uh yes and i mean this is only the first step right because this is all off-the-shelf hardware so what what is also um an intent of this of this workshop here is to think beyond what we're currently able to do what's the next workshop and see if if we had infinite budget in infinite time, what would we want to do?

**Meeting**,58,90," this should be available starting tomorrow. And we're expecting around about 20 terabytes to be generated over the four days? Roughly. I mean, we will probably be able to re-encode this stuff more efficiently in the post-processing step, so we might be able to shrink it down quite a bit. I'm expecting that we will generate about roughly 20 terabytes of data across all the cameras during this week. The ultimate size of the final data set depends on a bunch of stuff. It's difficult to predict at this point in time.

One of them might even have an agreement to install this. We can re-image it. Yeah, but that's a good point. You can re-image laptops, right? My laptop? Well, I mean, you could also... One could also go and basically pause the camera, prepare a chord diagram diagram, bring the camera so it's only the chord diagram visible. And then you play for a while and then... It's difficult because, well, Klaus' situation. Yes, because of others. No, no, I'm saying, well, if you turn off and you prepare it inside, right? In your room. You bring it out. No, not me."
Talking,406,495, I'm just saying.
Meeting,495,498," But of course, there could be notifications and stuff like this. This is already leading us into the homework that people should have to do. right so the the agenda item for tomorrow is essentially to discuss and present and discuss all the things you came up with for both the ideas for the challenge and the ideas for the hackathon. So I would ask everybody to throughout the day think about this. If you want to discuss this with other, feel free to discuss this with other people. If you want to write things down, feel free to write things down. If you want to prepare some slides, feel free to prepare some slides. If you don't want to prepare some slides, feel free to just do this without. All of this is perfectly fine. But ideally we have a bunch of stuff ready for tomorrow that we can't and have any discussion about and that will guide us towards more concrete in the structure that and say tomorrow we should talk about the grand challenge it's the obvious thing to discuss what kind of a I mean it's it's the mean, it kind of goes hand in hand, right? Because some of this will involve doing data augmentation. Some of this data augmentation we will do beforehand.

"Based on the visual information, the segment is best classified as **Walking**. 

Here's why:

* **The perspective:** The image is captured from a low-angle, forward-facing perspective, typical of someone walking or cycling.
* **The environment:** The scene depicts a narrow, paved road with overgrowth on the sides, suggesting an outdoor path.
* **The presence of a person:** A person is partially visible on the right side of the frame, looking ahead, which further supports the idea of movement. 

While other activities might occur outdoors, the visual cues strongly indicate walking.",1201,1203," Stakkpartið er fyrir fyrir fjarni og handpartið er fyrir hætti. Það er hætti. Það er hætti.

Here's why:

*   **Dining Table:** The image clearly shows a dining table.
*   **Place Settings:** There appear to be place settings (plates, possibly cutlery) arranged on the table.
*   **Table Runner/Placemats:** Red placemats or a table runner are visible, which are used for setting the table.
*   **Centerpiece:** A vase with flowers, a common centerpiece for a set table, is present.

"This image appears to be taken from a first-person perspective inside a home, likely near the entrance or a common area. The background shows a kitchen or dining area with what looks like a counter, stools, and tiled flooring. There's also a hint of a doorway with a glass panel, possibly a front door with decorative glass. 

Given the context of a home environment and the presence of a kitchen area, the most fitting classification for this scene would be **Leisure Activities**. This broad category encompasses various home-based activities that aren't specifically related to work or chores. 

Without more information or clearer details, it's difficult to pinpoint a more specific leisure activity. However, if one were to guess, it could be someone who has just arrived home and is about to engage in a leisure activity, or they could be in the process of something like preparing a meal or tidying up before relaxing.",558,559," Ja ma arvan, et teid.

"Based on the image, the most fitting category is **Cooking**.

Here's why:

*   **Presence of ingredients:** There are fruits (bananas, oranges, pineapple), and possibly other food items visible on the counter.
*   **Kitchen setting:** The image clearly shows a kitchen environment with countertops, cabinets, and appliances.
*   **Utensils and equipment:** We can see a knife, a cutting board, bowls, and what appears to be a stovetop or oven in the background.

While other activities might occur in a kitchen, the visual cues strongly suggest food preparation is taking place.",2739,2741," whoever wins, go first so you can go first let's see what we do so it's your turn no it's this one i've been i've won this one i think it makes it easier to the side so we go clockwise and there is a counterclockwise trend.
