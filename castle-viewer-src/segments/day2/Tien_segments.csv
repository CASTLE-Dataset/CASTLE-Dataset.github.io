"The image provided appears to be a still from a video. Based on the visual information within the image, I can classify the segment into the following category:

**Leisure Activities**

Here's why:

*   **People are gathered in a living room setting.** This suggests a relaxed, non-work-related environment.
*   **There are elements that indicate activities typically associated with leisure:** a fireplace, shelves with decorative items, and what appears to be a TV.
*   **One person is brushing their hair**, which could be part of getting ready to go out, or simply a personal grooming activity during a relaxed time.
*   **Another person is looking at something on a laptop**, and a QR code is visible, which could indicate browsing, gaming, or some form of online entertainment.
*   **The overall atmosphere suggests people are spending time together in a comfortable setting.**

While there might be secondary activities happening (like using a laptop), the overarching context points to leisure.",1351,1353," If you do, you do a decent wash. Don't you want to have this one?

Eating,2538,2543," And we will consider a hackathon as well, but multimedia is a key thing today."
Eating,2543,2551," We are given the money by SIG-MM. They requested that we run something that's like BBS and L actually at ACM Multimedia. Get together, figure it out, do it. It has to be interactive. You didn't say that but since I said it has to be like, it should be like VBS slash LSE, it probably is something with an interactive element to it. data set released, bit of training data, maybe a closed workshop and a public open session. That is how I think it's going to happen. So look for something that's not the obvious, release a data set, set a date, get people together, run a challenge, give some topics, Q&A and ad hoc and see what happens. That's the default approach. Is there something you want to do that's better or more novel than that? Does anybody have any ideas? Let's worry about the challenge first so the hackathon can happen hackathon well the question is does the challenge have to have one single task or could it be multiple ones yeah it's up to us there's a workshop and i don't know i imagine there will be an associated workshop and the grand challenge tied to the workshop because i think they're here yeah i mean i i was also thinking like i mean given given the bias we'll have in the data set there is a lot of research on multimedia for cooking eating so basically one one thought would be basically do whatever you have on your data set and just test it on this data set don't use any training data from this dataset. See how this transfers to new data. And of course I guess we want to do something like more LSC style interactive queries. I mean from the from the backlog of things that we want to do is one thing that we always, for VBS also, was trying to see how precisely you phrase queries or how simple you keep the language. There is always this tension between you simple words that everyone understands versus being precise so that might be something also to to study but this is of course needs comparison so either you split it up to groups if we have enough participants that's good work but we didn't know in advance probably because I think we should like build a hybrid benchmark for everyone to compare them when they create a new idea but for annual competition we should like change the task to a new one and motivate them to create a new idea or train their method to compete with other teams so yeah that's my idea the usual grand challenge formats which i think we should stick to at least for the part that we label as a challenge is an asynchronous operation. You get your data, you get your task, you get the time to process to do whatever it is you think you need to do to solve the task, you send in your results, you get your scores back and there's going to be result presentation of everybody or the top scoring teams. So it's not very alike to LSE and VBS? Yeah, I mean, this is something we can do on top of this, that we have a session where something happens live. I i think that's what they literally asked us i mean that's one thing that makes this format very unique this interaction and why is it kind of i think interesting that we look at right some form of interaction in the age of these conversational systems because these are conversational systems being from the beginning beginning. So we can do some kind of data mining where they build a system, more like exploration system, and then at the challenge we will have very specific questions for that. For example, regarding group dynamics, so they will have to build a system that can visualize the group dynamics and show some kind of interaction like more and very user experience space and then at the challenge we do we ask some question live and they have to use the system to answer that it's like who did I talk to the most today or something like that but these questions questions are only released at the challenge live. Yes, I would just now limit it to something like this because the barrier of entry for these sort of things is very high, right? So you need a complete stack to be able to do this. Asynchronous and synchronous. Yes. Whereas if you just give out some tasks, people can put some algorithms together however they want. It only needs to run exactly once on whatever resources they might have and they can produce those results. This might not cover all the things but it it is certainly for some interesting tasks, it might be entirely sufficient that they can build their thing, it runs on whatever they have, it will take a while to run, we'll produce some output, we will look at the output and tell them how well they did. So something that has a low barrier to entry, asynchronous submission to take part in the Grand Challenge, but there is an attractive element to the Grand Challenge which is tied to a workshop, which is somehow different to the Hackathon. And I guess the Hackathon should have all the things we can not evaluate, whereas there is they're either we don't have a ground truth or there cannot be a ground truth because there is some some ambiguity there whereas the challenges should have a a clear mechanism by which you can tell how much of this you got right we kind of do this with anti-CIR all right That email I send out periodically and everybody ignores. We kind of do this with NTCIR where we do have this asynchronous challenge. You build your system, you give me the queries, which we've got to look at a few today. You have not seen any of them. We release the queries. The queries are more descriptives than an LSE query. It has a title, a description, and description and then a narrative that says oh and eating breakfast is relevant only if it includes Werner that doesn't description like that makes it very very clear and people do that in their own time by a certain date they submit their runs we pool all people's rules together and generate a ground truth we don't evaluate everything it's not a complete ground truth it's a pool ground truth so it's never gonna be perfect but it's gonna be sufficient in the frenzy existence that we can do not okay that's simple we do that all the challenge here is probably a bit more difficult data to walk with but that's great then we can do some really interesting interactions in that workshop where the queries are different like some kind of really there's this interaction queries that we have as well. The time I was talking to Ali about the NTCR queries we hadn't yet released. What was the outcome of that conversation? Those kinds of things. Much nicer things to do. And that's really interesting I think for an interactive challenge. Not just finders."

It has to be interactive. You didn't say that but since I said it has to be like, it should be like VBS slash LSE, it probably is something with an interactive element to it. data set released, bit of training data, maybe a closed workshop and a public open session. That is how I think it's going to happen. So look for something that's not the obvious, release a data set, set a date, get people together, run a challenge, give some topics, Q&A and ad hoc and see what happens. That's the default approach. Is there something you want to do that's better or more novel than that? Does anybody have any ideas? Let's worry about the challenge first so the hackathon can happen hackathon well the question is does the challenge have to have one single task or could it be multiple ones yeah it's up to us there's a workshop and i don't know i imagine there will be an associated workshop and the grand challenge tied to the workshop because i think they're here yeah i mean i i was also thinking like i mean given given the bias we'll have in the data set there is a lot of research on multimedia for cooking eating so basically one one thought would be basically do whatever you have on your data set and just test it on this data set don't use any training data from this dataset. See how this transfers to new data. And of course I guess we want to do something like more LSC style interactive queries. I mean from the from the backlog of things that we want to do is one thing that we always, for VBS also, was trying to see how precisely you phrase queries or how simple you keep the language. There is always this tension between you simple words that everyone understands versus being precise so that might be something also to to study but this is of course needs comparison so either you split it up to groups if we have enough participants that's good work but we didn't know in advance probably because I think we should like build a hybrid benchmark for everyone to compare them when they create a new idea but for annual competition we should like change the task to a new one and motivate them to create a new idea or train their method to compete with other teams so yeah that's my idea the usual grand challenge formats which i think we should stick to at least for the part that we label as a challenge is an asynchronous operation. You get your data, you get your task, you get the time to process to do whatever it is you think you need to do to solve the task, you send in your results, you get your scores back and there's going to be result presentation of everybody or the top scoring teams. So it's not very alike to LSE and VBS? Yeah, I mean, this is something we can do on top of this, that we have a session where something happens live. I i think that's what they literally asked us i mean that's one thing that makes this format very unique this interaction and why is it kind of i think interesting that we look at right some form of interaction in the age of these conversational systems because these are conversational systems being from the beginning beginning. So we can do some kind of data mining where they build a system, more like exploration system, and then at the challenge we will have very specific questions for that. For example, regarding group dynamics, so they will have to build a system that can visualize the group dynamics and show some kind of interaction like more and very user experience space and then at the challenge we do we ask some question live and they have to use the system to answer that it's like who did I talk to the most today or something like that but these questions questions are only released at the challenge live. Yes, I would just now limit it to something like this because the barrier of entry for these sort of things is very high, right? So you need a complete stack to be able to do this. Asynchronous and synchronous. Yes. Whereas if you just give out some tasks, people can put some algorithms together however they want. It only needs to run exactly once on whatever resources they might have and they can produce those results. This might not cover all the things but it it is certainly for some interesting tasks, it might be entirely sufficient that they can build their thing, it runs on whatever they have, it will take a while to run, we'll produce some output, we will look at the output and tell them how well they did.

And that's really interesting I think for an interactive challenge. Not just finders."
Playing Games,3243,3674," But this is a different... This is also somewhat difficult to evaluate, because you need to phrase this very precisely, because what was the outcome of this conversation is not something that has a precise answer. But that's what we do with the judges, right? The judges make decisions in... Yeah, but currently what we have is like the judges get something that is very short answer, with some degrees of freedom, but if you like ask for outcome of a conversation, you could write a paragraph on that. Yeah, okay, we limit the... Like we do this with the Q&A things already. What airline? Oh, Turkish Airlines. Or Turkish, fine, you vote okay. We do it. We only don't phrase it like that. So basically how the queries in a known item and I think not in ad hoc but in known item I think are formulated that's a multi-turn retrieval. If we don't go for a full conversation but conversational for example, that's pretty much how you formulate and evaluate query story. You provide a bit of information, then people stop looking, then it's funny, you know, on the microphone people say, okay, nobody finding, and then typically Werner or you kind of says, aha, additional piece of information, you know. Like that girl running up the hill with a father towards the flag. Then you provide the next bit of information. But what is the target? Is it a pure retrieval task? As in find the end of this conversational chain for this example? Or is it a... You need to somehow summarize this conversation into two phrases. Evaluating summary is super difficult. I... Most of us did it that time. Maybe my example was bad. It doesn't necessarily have to be the outcome of a conversation. It can be the outcome of cooking breakfast on the third day. How many croissants were left? Whatever is that kind of query. We make the query something that actually you can identify and you can be pretty sure it's correct or reasonably correct. Yes, but this is an easy fact-finding. And then you could either have a pure value as a result, as in, I did something, my answer is 3, I'm not going to tell you how I got to it. Or you have to actually the crossholes and say well show me all the all the instances and then I can go oh yeah this is one, this is two, this is three. There's actually a theory of this problem. The issue at IV or IVB where one of the teams actually Arlan's team, the guy was guessing the answers. Yeah. Yeah. He guessed it right twice. Allegedly. Very badly. Very badly. So you're moving towards like reasoning. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Providing evidence. Yeah. That's what Trakvi did, you remember? Multimedia Event Detection was? Yeah. Yeah. That was what they call summarization. It was a bit of a blasphemy to call it summarization because it was just evidence. Yeah, exactly. I mean, I guess you can get to multiple levels. You can just provide an explanation and say, because I have seen those scenes on three pictures, that's how I come... Or you really provide a list of evidence and say, this is the picture, this is the picture I used. Yeah, you can provide a distance at the time. That's asynchronous then, right? Metatask was asynchronous. Yeah, I mean you could do it in a synchronous thing as well if you have a system doing that. Of course, you can do that in an interactive way and you have things that the user reasoned and the system doesn't know about, then it gets difficult. But at least, I mean, I guess it could be interesting to build a system that also can keep this evidence. So basically that when you provide the answer, you have the things you looked at and say, well, this is the information I used to come up with the answer. I would like to bring an additional aspect to this discussion, because the grand challenge traditionally was always funded by companies in a way that they also get some output, right? And even though I fully agree with all of you that we need interactive challenges, I think for the grand challenge at ACM Multimedia, we could also maybe do some subtasks like labeling. For example, many people in multimedia are working on food recognition. So it could be a collaborative annotation task also. And then later on that collaborative annotation we could extract metadata and later on maybe use it for the interactive challenges as a ground truth even though it might not be completely correct. But as a challenge, if you put it as a challenge, how do you evaluate it? I mean the challenge has kind of this competition character. Is that the hackathon stuff? Yeah, exactly. There's more hackathon, yeah. Let me tell you what came out of that meeting in HTML3 on the first morning. It was a health-based hackathon. That's what they wanted to do. And we're naturally going to feed into that if we use this data. I mean there's some very interesting things we can do about this. For example, all of these things have barcodes on them. Right, right, right. So you can cross-reference this with the International ProDoc database and know exactly what this was. And then you can track how much of this happens to be. Right, good idea. How much of this was consumed over what amount of time. Very good idea. And I mean, essentially, it will be difficult to track who actually consumed what."

No, you must put one single card because this is the... Because you start with a single card. We can play straight too, right? Sorry? Let's say we have 3, 4, 5, 6. In your turn, but now because the turn is only one card, so you must follow one card. So that's different. So something that's higher than that. Yes. So then I have to find something bigger, for example. And also, you missed that part. This is the smallest in the color, so then this is bigger. Yeah. I think... The space is smallest, and then to the club, and then diamond, and heart. This is the smallest? Yes. So I can go with this, because I have... What? Yes. So then I have to start first. No, no, no. have yes no no no no no now it's too late we're still going right going oh yes yeah okay yeah no no he said no yeah she was right because she got the three up there oh you had a decent three yeah but I put the seven first at, at the beginning, she should be the star. Oh, right, right, right. Let's go this. This is what would have happened, right? So, wait, so this is the smallest. You first and then... Wait, this is the smallest and what's after that? This one. No, she said off the... So let's say you go first and then go for this and then Bjorn go for seven and then this. So off the suits basically the order."
Playing Games,248,289," Yeah, but what is the hot pot can be well i want to make sure it's safe because it's actually what do you think it's uh we have to use by the fourth of december yeah but what is the hot pot today we eat at lunch i think it's due to much chicken we have no we got two chicken meals there's chicken hot pot and there's chicken curry chicken curry yeah thursday yeah i think that's okay we'll check and see okay if you don't need chicken as a question i i don't need chicken i mean i can probably integrate chicken if you want but how about lamb no no no no no we have two kilograms of lamb this is uh aloo gobi and dal so it's basically vegetarian food yes well depends on the there's probably going to be some butter in there but outside that yeah but it's different that's missed one right so we can do a demo so you can open all of your car of course you don't in in the real match you don't but let's open everything and then we can play right okay so wow i have three tools so that means something strong. Oh, very strong, almost you win. Okay. Unless you are really unlucky otherwise. Or stupid. No, you are not, so then, only you are really unlucky. Or don't know the game. Yes, that's also the case. So then there's question of strategy, right? Not even strategy, but how evil you are, because you can skip it, even if you can move, but you can skip it if you want to. So it's on your choice. You're not forced to go. Right. And sometimes because of the points, if I hate you, and I'm the next one, I always try my best. Even if I know I will lose the game, but because I hate you, I will make you... You try to give me the points yes okay especially ambush right say very secret and then so we show our card to I'm just trying to teach me the game yeah I still don't understand the game yes you can you can leave yes so now now don't don for the boy. The boy is too complicated. Go for single game first. So now the guy who have the smallest one go first. Can you see yours? I got five. So that's it like here. I must go. Right. And then here I have no combination. I have no pair of three. I don't have strap from three. So you need to put the lowest card. Yes, I must put this Okay, so I must put this okay, and then the bands and we did I can put anything I want Higher than this higher than this and here. I would probably pick yes, exactly.

If you go for that one first, he might have something that is possibly higher No, but it doesn't matter because I have four cards, I have four cards so it's impossible for me to win Well unless you have a pair of two yeah no impossible because yes because there's only one here so you have to remember also the card but if you have a pair of twos then it will be your turn and so yeah but if i have more than you maybe be careful if i have four uh pairs yeah yeah sure sure but that's very rare very rare because that's okay you will you will lost multiple because you got an ambush.

If you play single, you don't count the penalty, then no problem. Really, but then whoever gets to be the king, we have to exchange the card with the slave.

In this case yeah i should have done something else no in this case i will go okay yeah because and then you beat me yes and then you go for any pair uh because now i can now it's your turn yes and then let's keep it yeah if i really do i'll just go for that first let's say we don't know yes in the game, in the real game you should go for this one. Okay. No, but it doesn't matter but yeah But why? Tell me why Because let's say you don't know that guy, only two of you left right? If you go for that one first, he might have something that is possibly higher No, but it doesn't matter because I have four cards, I have four cards so it's impossible for me to win Well unless you have a pair of two yeah no impossible because yes because there's only one here so you have to remember also the card but if you have a pair of twos then it will be your turn and so yeah but if i have more than you maybe be careful if i have four uh pairs yeah yeah sure sure but that's very rare very rare because that's okay you will you will lost multiple because you got an ambush.

If you go for that one first, he might have something that is possibly higher No, but it doesn't matter because I have four cards, I have four cards so it's impossible for me to win Well unless you have a pair of two yeah no impossible because yes because there's only one here so you have to remember also the card but if you have a pair of twos then it will be your turn and so yeah but if i have more than you maybe be careful if i have four uh pairs yeah yeah sure sure but that's very rare very rare because that's okay you will you will lost multiple because you got an ambush. So if I... Normally it's only two points each. But then if they have an ambush with four boys negative to yours. Okay. And the worst thing is we have like... We have like... If you have this... Let's say you play this one Hmm. Yes, and then I go for this. I'm higher what what what? What are we playing? What are we playing Vietnamese? Can't say that I'm playing I'm learning But I explained this So complicated so let's say if she goes for this one if you go for this, she will lose one point because you are higher than number two. Let's say I go for number two, so you lose another one point, she lose one point. But if she have an ambush, let's say she have like eight, nine, and ten. Then all of the negative go to me, the last one, because that's huge benefit. You lose nothing, she lose nothing, but I got minus 4. That is the part I don't really understand. Why do we count point 2? Because we play for many games, not one single game. So it's like poker in the long run. So what me and my friend play is that who won gets to be the king and who yeah that we do is also but that's the simple version the more complicated version you long go for runtime let's say who reached 100 is the one who the winner yeah something like this or 50. right yes and and for this you get negative almost four eight points already so a new twin sister there's a different game but they were basically counting points and they played for weeks yeah they had a book every time at school they had a break they would start playing yes and then they just kept going and so they were making some really numbers if you play a single game is quite okay but this losing the evil part of a human yes because then become a quite. You just play it. How would you count the points for the last game? So you will get two points. He got one point, I got zero. So, four parts, right? Yes. So, simple game, yes. If you play single, you don't count the penalty, then no problem. Really, but then whoever gets to be the king, we have to exchange the card with the slave. Give them like... the slave has to give two base cards, something like that. But if anyone wins, the king immediately goes straight to be a slave."

You just play it. How would you count the points for the last game? So you will get two points. He got one point, I got zero. So, four parts, right? Yes. So, simple game, yes. If you play single, you don't count the penalty, then no problem. Really, but then whoever gets to be the king, we have to exchange the card with the slave. Give them like... the slave has to give two base cards, something like that. But if anyone wins, the king immediately goes straight to be a slave."

In this case yeah i should have done something else no in this case i will go okay yeah because and then you beat me yes and then you go for any pair uh because now i can now it's your turn yes and then let's keep it yeah if i really do i'll just go for that first let's say we don't know yes in the game, in the real game you should go for this one. Okay. No, but it doesn't matter but yeah But why? Tell me why Because let's say you don't know that guy, only two of you left right? If you go for that one first, he might have something that is possibly higher No, but it doesn't matter because I have four cards, I have four cards so it's impossible for me to win Well unless you have a pair of two yeah no impossible because yes because there's only one here so you have to remember also the card but if you have a pair of twos then it will be your turn and so yeah but if i have more than you maybe be careful if i have four uh pairs yeah yeah sure sure but that's very rare very rare because that's okay you will you will lost multiple because you got an ambush.

You can put down one card, you can put down a sequence of cards, like three, four, five, six, seven different seven different suits so it's either you can put on pairs or triples or something like this yes and then everybody else has to follow that follow that pattern ah okay but always put higher but this is like like uh jolly uh maybe because i don't know that game either okay but always will put higher but the order of suits is a little bit different so So you know spade is the lowest Yes, yeah clubs then yes, yeah diamonds and hearts Okay, so if somebody puts down, you know, let's say if I put number two then you have to put this This is higher put on three of clubs on top Okay, so you have to follow that sequence. So you can't put three just three of this No, but if for somebody puts different colors, but you have no, no, you have to raise. You have to raise. So let's say you have an order of 52 cards. Okay, so you can mix numbers. So if it's just one card, then you can basically... Go for one card. You put one card as long as it's higher. Okay, and it's higher...

These are additions to the rules made by sore losers. I cannot have lost, you know. I have so good cards. There's a rule. And basically that's it, because now we go for the simple version so we don't go for the points. Then apparently there's more. The points are so complicated and that makes the game very interesting. Like all the exceptions you have from schedules. There is actually a mountain hub somewhere in Austria that has a sign like a proper bus stop. And it basically says the bus is running every day and then there is just all exceptions that you end up with. There is no bus. And when you make a sequence, you don't include number two. So this is like, if a sequence, this is the biggest one. This is the biggest. Let's say you have this, then nothing can beat this. Okay, yeah. Even you have four, two, or four bears, whatever, doesn't matter. Nothing can beat this? Nothing can beat this. No, nothing. It's a sequence. Yeah, it's a sequence. And then this is the biggest in the sequence. Ah. Okay, yeah. Because it's the ace of hearts. And yes, it's always the biggest. It's a sequence. Yeah, it's a sequence. And this is the biggest in the sequence. Ah. Because it's the ace of hearts. And the ace is always the biggest. It's not like... Because in some card games... No, if one heart... It's the biggest one in this. But this game, number two is the biggest. But number two is not in the sequence. Apart from number two, yeah. Because in some games, ace is either the largest or one, but it's not. That's why I think the game sometimes name duos or two or something. So the three of spades is the lowest card. Yes. Yeah, okay. So like here I have this so I go first. So three of spades goes first. Yes. Basically since we have all the cards in the game. Yeah, so I go first and then we go for the clock circle so then now it's like this guy have very strong card because i have this and this it's very hard to beat me yeah i guess it's also very hard to beat you because you're the one who knows the rules. Well, not true. Oh my god. Yes, you can do that. I skip. That's an option too. Okay, so now what could I do on top of it? You can't. Because I have three aces. Threees yeah basically any any like queen king ace with any of this age with one of these two aces yeah exactly well actually any of them yes yeah right yes but could i do any any any hard color or any no no no no no because you need you need to end in an ace that's higher than the ace of spades. Yeah Okay, that's another constraint. No, no big because you're basically you have to play something higher, right? Yes The definition of higher here is is that the top card is the height? Yes It's the top card that determines the height of the yes true But but I understood the color it's it's either the number or the color is No, the number had to be higher. But since the aces are higher. If the same number, then you go for the suit. But if I have a color that is higher, like a heart? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. If you have... But it needs to be a straight. Like I have a heart four. It needs to be a straight. Yeah, no, no. It needs to be a straight. Ah, okay. And the end of the straight, so straight means in order. Yeah, okay. And the top card of the straight needs to be higher than the top card of this straight so it could only be an ace in this case yes exactly you skip because you have all of them yeah you must skip yeah yeah yeah yeah so let's say even I can choose to skip here so let's suppose you skip and I think of it so the only one that cannot skip is this one.

Even you have four, two, or four bears, whatever, doesn't matter. Nothing can beat this? Nothing can beat this. No, nothing. It's a sequence. Yeah, it's a sequence. And then this is the biggest in the sequence. Ah. Okay, yeah. Because it's the ace of hearts. And yes, it's always the biggest. It's a sequence. Yeah, it's a sequence. And this is the biggest in the sequence. Ah. Because it's the ace of hearts. And the ace is always the biggest. It's not like... Because in some card games... No, if one heart... It's the biggest one in this. But this game, number two is the biggest. But number two is not in the sequence. Apart from number two, yeah. Because in some games, ace is either the largest or one, but it's not. That's why I think the game sometimes name duos or two or something. So the three of spades is the lowest card. Yes. Yeah, okay. So like here I have this so I go first. So three of spades goes first. Yes. Basically since we have all the cards in the game. Yeah, so I go first and then we go for the clock circle so then now it's like this guy have very strong card because i have this and this it's very hard to beat me yeah i guess it's also very hard to beat you because you're the one who knows the rules. Well, not true. Oh my god. Yes, you can do that. I skip. That's an option too. Okay, so now what could I do on top of it? You can't. Because I have three aces. Threees yeah basically any any like queen king ace with any of this age with one of these two aces yeah exactly well actually any of them yes yeah right yes but could i do any any any hard color or any no no no no no because you need you need to end in an ace that's higher than the ace of spades. Yeah Okay, that's another constraint. No, no big because you're basically you have to play something higher, right? Yes The definition of higher here is is that the top card is the height? Yes It's the top card that determines the height of the yes true But but I understood the color it's it's either the number or the color is No, the number had to be higher. But since the aces are higher. If the same number, then you go for the suit. But if I have a color that is higher, like a heart? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. If you have... But it needs to be a straight. Like I have a heart four. It needs to be a straight. Yeah, no, no. It needs to be a straight. Ah, okay. And the end of the straight, so straight means in order. Yeah, okay. And the top card of the straight needs to be higher than the top card of this straight so it could only be an ace in this case yes exactly you skip because you have all of them yeah you must skip yeah yeah yeah yeah so let's say even I can choose to skip here so let's suppose you skip and I think of it so the only one that cannot skip is this one. No, I can skip also. You can skip, but you could choose to do something. Yeah, I can choose to do something. So let's suppose you skip, then you go.

No, but if you choose, like if you could see that when it's your turn, then you could actually play because you have a... Yes. And then it's your turn to do and you dictate the play basically. Yes. Right. Yes. Yes. There you go. Just make examples. So now it's basically a different... I saw, okay, okay. Now she, because her turn, she... Okay, but I could have also started something new? No, because... And we need to wait the complete round. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So now you have... Okay. Now you just need 5 to pair bigger than 4. Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, you can choose. It's your turn now. Yeah, okay. Now it's your turn. So here it just picks the pattern. This is interesting. Okay. And I can put more, right? You can put 5 pair num pay ups no you must eat a pair because this is pair four so you put a pair of six six and six i okay i need to take another six are you winning again can i i might take this i also have the heart six could i take three of them cannot, I have to follow the pattern. Okay. Okay. So then I can go, for example, this. This. And it's quite hard because you need to pair up 2. And normally people don't want to get risk to go and pair up 2. It's your turn. Yeah. Aha.

And this is the biggest in the sequence. Ah. Because it's the ace of hearts. And the ace is always the biggest. It's not like... Because in some card games... No, if one heart... It's the biggest one in this. But this game, number two is the biggest. But number two is not in the sequence. Apart from number two, yeah. Because in some games, ace is either the largest or one, but it's not. That's why I think the game sometimes name duos or two or something. So the three of spades is the lowest card. Yes. Yeah, okay. So like here I have this so I go first. So three of spades goes first. Yes. Basically since we have all the cards in the game. Yeah, so I go first and then we go for the clock circle so then now it's like this guy have very strong card because i have this and this it's very hard to beat me yeah i guess it's also very hard to beat you because you're the one who knows the rules. Well, not true. Oh my god. Yes, you can do that. I skip. That's an option too. Okay, so now what could I do on top of it? You can't. Because I have three aces. Threees yeah basically any any like queen king ace with any of this age with one of these two aces yeah exactly well actually any of them yes yeah right yes but could i do any any any hard color or any no no no no no because you need you need to end in an ace that's higher than the ace of spades. Yeah Okay, that's another constraint. No, no big because you're basically you have to play something higher, right? Yes The definition of higher here is is that the top card is the height? Yes It's the top card that determines the height of the yes true But but I understood the color it's it's either the number or the color is No, the number had to be higher. But since the aces are higher. If the same number, then you go for the suit. But if I have a color that is higher, like a heart? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. If you have... But it needs to be a straight. Like I have a heart four. It needs to be a straight. Yeah, no, no. It needs to be a straight. Ah, okay. And the end of the straight, so straight means in order. Yeah, okay. And the top card of the straight needs to be higher than the top card of this straight so it could only be an ace in this case yes exactly you skip because you have all of them yeah you must skip yeah yeah yeah yeah so let's say even I can choose to skip here so let's suppose you skip and I think of it so the only one that cannot skip is this one. No, I can skip also. You can skip, but you could choose to do something. Yeah, I can choose to do something. So let's suppose you skip, then you go.

No, but if you choose, like if you could see that when it's your turn, then you could actually play because you have a... Yes. And then it's your turn to do and you dictate the play basically. Yes. Right. Yes. Yes. There you go. Just make examples. So now it's basically a different... I saw, okay, okay. Now she, because her turn, she... Okay, but I could have also started something new? No, because... And we need to wait the complete round. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So now you have... Okay. Now you just need 5 to pair bigger than 4. Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, you can choose. It's your turn now. Yeah, okay. Now it's your turn. So here it just picks the pattern. This is interesting. Okay. And I can put more, right? You can put 5 pair num pay ups no you must eat a pair because this is pair four so you put a pair of six six and six i okay i need to take another six are you winning again can i i might take this i also have the heart six could i take three of them cannot, I have to follow the pattern. Okay. Okay. So then I can go, for example, this. This. And it's quite hard because you need to pair up 2. And normally people don't want to get risk to go and pair up 2. It's your turn. Yeah. Aha.

But since the aces are higher. If the same number, then you go for the suit. But if I have a color that is higher, like a heart? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. If you have... But it needs to be a straight. Like I have a heart four. It needs to be a straight. Yeah, no, no. It needs to be a straight. Ah, okay. And the end of the straight, so straight means in order. Yeah, okay. And the top card of the straight needs to be higher than the top card of this straight so it could only be an ace in this case yes exactly you skip because you have all of them yeah you must skip yeah yeah yeah yeah so let's say even I can choose to skip here so let's suppose you skip and I think of it so the only one that cannot skip is this one. No, I can skip also. You can skip, but you could choose to do something. Yeah, I can choose to do something. So let's suppose you skip, then you go.

No, but if you choose, like if you could see that when it's your turn, then you could actually play because you have a... Yes. And then it's your turn to do and you dictate the play basically. Yes. Right. Yes. Yes. There you go. Just make examples. So now it's basically a different... I saw, okay, okay. Now she, because her turn, she... Okay, but I could have also started something new? No, because... And we need to wait the complete round. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So now you have... Okay. Now you just need 5 to pair bigger than 4. Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, you can choose. It's your turn now. Yeah, okay. Now it's your turn. So here it just picks the pattern. This is interesting. Okay. And I can put more, right? You can put 5 pair num pay ups no you must eat a pair because this is pair four so you put a pair of six six and six i okay i need to take another six are you winning again can i i might take this i also have the heart six could i take three of them cannot, I have to follow the pattern. Okay. Okay. So then I can go, for example, this. This. And it's quite hard because you need to pair up 2. And normally people don't want to get risk to go and pair up 2. It's your turn. Yeah. Aha.

It's the biggest one in this. But this game, number two is the biggest. But number two is not in the sequence. Apart from number two, yeah. Because in some games, ace is either the largest or one, but it's not. That's why I think the game sometimes name duos or two or something. So the three of spades is the lowest card. Yes. Yeah, okay.

And it basically says the bus is running every day and then there is just all exceptions that you end up with. There is no bus. And when you make a sequence, you don't include number two. So this is like, if a sequence, this is the biggest one. This is the biggest. Let's say you have this, then nothing can beat this. Okay, yeah. Even you have four, two, or four bears, whatever, doesn't matter. Nothing can beat this? Nothing can beat this. No, nothing. It's a sequence. Yeah, it's a sequence. And then this is the biggest in the sequence. Ah. Okay, yeah. Because it's the ace of hearts. And yes, it's always the biggest. It's a sequence. Yeah, it's a sequence. And this is the biggest in the sequence. Ah. Because it's the ace of hearts. And the ace is always the biggest. It's not like... Because in some card games... No, if one heart... It's the biggest one in this. But this game, number two is the biggest. But number two is not in the sequence. Apart from number two, yeah. Because in some games, ace is either the largest or one, but it's not. That's why I think the game sometimes name duos or two or something. So the three of spades is the lowest card. Yes. Yeah, okay. So like here I have this so I go first. So three of spades goes first. Yes. Basically since we have all the cards in the game. Yeah, so I go first and then we go for the clock circle so then now it's like this guy have very strong card because i have this and this it's very hard to beat me yeah i guess it's also very hard to beat you because you're the one who knows the rules. Well, not true. Oh my god. Yes, you can do that. I skip. That's an option too. Okay, so now what could I do on top of it? You can't. Because I have three aces. Threees yeah basically any any like queen king ace with any of this age with one of these two aces yeah exactly well actually any of them yes yeah right yes but could i do any any any hard color or any no no no no no because you need you need to end in an ace that's higher than the ace of spades. Yeah Okay, that's another constraint. No, no big because you're basically you have to play something higher, right? Yes The definition of higher here is is that the top card is the height? Yes It's the top card that determines the height of the yes true But but I understood the color it's it's either the number or the color is No, the number had to be higher. But since the aces are higher. If the same number, then you go for the suit. But if I have a color that is higher, like a heart? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. If you have... But it needs to be a straight. Like I have a heart four. It needs to be a straight. Yeah, no, no. It needs to be a straight. Ah, okay. And the end of the straight, so straight means in order. Yeah, okay. And the top card of the straight needs to be higher than the top card of this straight so it could only be an ace in this case yes exactly you skip because you have all of them yeah you must skip yeah yeah yeah yeah so let's say even I can choose to skip here so let's suppose you skip and I think of it so the only one that cannot skip is this one. No, I can skip also. You can skip, but you could choose to do something. Yeah, I can choose to do something. So let's suppose you skip, then you go. And if you want it to be your turn, for example, then you could basically... No, if I skip it, this is like a new turn, so I cannot do anything. No, but if you choose, like if you could see that when it's your turn, then you could actually play because you have a... Yes. And then it's your turn to do and you dictate the play basically. Yes. Right. Yes. Yes. There you go. Just make examples. So now it's basically a different... I saw, okay, okay. Now she, because her turn, she... Okay, but I could have also started something new? No, because... And we need to wait the complete round. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So now you have... Okay. Now you just need 5 to pair bigger than 4. Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, you can choose. It's your turn now. Yeah, okay. Now it's your turn. So here it just picks the pattern. This is interesting. Okay. And I can put more, right? You can put 5 pair num pay ups no you must eat a pair because this is pair four so you put a pair of six six and six i okay i need to take another six are you winning again can i i might take this i also have the heart six could i take three of them cannot, I have to follow the pattern. Okay. Okay. So then I can go, for example, this. This. And it's quite hard because you need to pair up 2. And normally people don't want to get risk to go and pair up 2. It's your turn. Yeah. Aha. Yes. And then... I have a pair of 2, so I can do that. Yes. And I could... No, I would need 4 pairs to beat that right? Yes four back continuously"

It's the biggest one in this. But this game, number two is the biggest. But number two is not in the sequence. Apart from number two, yeah. Because in some games, ace is either the largest or one, but it's not. That's why I think the game sometimes name duos or two or something. So the three of spades is the lowest card. Yes. Yeah, okay. So like here I have this so I go first. So three of spades goes first. Yes. Basically since we have all the cards in the game. Yeah, so I go first and then we go for the clock circle so then now it's like this guy have very strong card because i have this and this it's very hard to beat me yeah i guess it's also very hard to beat you because you're the one who knows the rules. Well, not true. Oh my god. Yes, you can do that. I skip. That's an option too. Okay, so now what could I do on top of it? You can't. Because I have three aces. Threees yeah basically any any like queen king ace with any of this age with one of these two aces yeah exactly well actually any of them yes yeah right yes but could i do any any any hard color or any no no no no no because you need you need to end in an ace that's higher than the ace of spades. Yeah Okay, that's another constraint. No, no big because you're basically you have to play something higher, right? Yes The definition of higher here is is that the top card is the height? Yes It's the top card that determines the height of the yes true But but I understood the color it's it's either the number or the color is No, the number had to be higher. But since the aces are higher. If the same number, then you go for the suit. But if I have a color that is higher, like a heart? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. If you have... But it needs to be a straight. Like I have a heart four. It needs to be a straight. Yeah, no, no. It needs to be a straight. Ah, okay. And the end of the straight, so straight means in order. Yeah, okay. And the top card of the straight needs to be higher than the top card of this straight so it could only be an ace in this case yes exactly you skip because you have all of them yeah you must skip yeah yeah yeah yeah so let's say even I can choose to skip here so let's suppose you skip and I think of it so the only one that cannot skip is this one. No, I can skip also. You can skip, but you could choose to do something. Yeah, I can choose to do something. So let's suppose you skip, then you go. And if you want it to be your turn, for example, then you could basically... No, if I skip it, this is like a new turn, so I cannot do anything. No, but if you choose, like if you could see that when it's your turn, then you could actually play because you have a... Yes. And then it's your turn to do and you dictate the play basically. Yes. Right. Yes. Yes. There you go. Just make examples. So now it's basically a different... I saw, okay, okay. Now she, because her turn, she... Okay, but I could have also started something new? No, because... And we need to wait the complete round. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So now you have... Okay. Now you just need 5 to pair bigger than 4. Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, you can choose. It's your turn now. Yeah, okay. Now it's your turn. So here it just picks the pattern. This is interesting. Okay. And I can put more, right? You can put 5 pair num pay ups no you must eat a pair because this is pair four so you put a pair of six six and six i okay i need to take another six are you winning again can i i might take this i also have the heart six could i take three of them cannot, I have to follow the pattern. Okay. Okay. So then I can go, for example, this. This. And it's quite hard because you need to pair up 2. And normally people don't want to get risk to go and pair up 2. It's your turn. Yeah. Aha.

No, because... And we need to wait the complete round. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So now you have... Okay. Now you just need 5 to pair bigger than 4. Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, you can choose.

You can put 5 pair num pay ups no you must eat a pair because this is pair four so you put a pair of six six and six i okay i need to take another six are you winning again can i i might take this i also have the heart six could i take three of them cannot, I have to follow the pattern. Okay. Okay. So then I can go, for example, this. This. And it's quite hard because you need to pair up 2. And normally people don't want to get risk to go and pair up 2. It's your turn. Yeah. Aha.

And this is the biggest in the sequence. Ah. Because it's the ace of hearts. And the ace is always the biggest. It's not like... Because in some card games... No, if one heart... It's the biggest one in this. But this game, number two is the biggest. But number two is not in the sequence. Apart from number two, yeah. Because in some games, ace is either the largest or one, but it's not. That's why I think the game sometimes name duos or two or something. So the three of spades is the lowest card. Yes. Yeah, okay.

Yeah Okay, that's another constraint. No, no big because you're basically you have to play something higher, right? Yes The definition of higher here is is that the top card is the height? Yes It's the top card that determines the height of the yes true But but I understood the color it's it's either the number or the color is No, the number had to be higher. But since the aces are higher. If the same number, then you go for the suit. But if I have a color that is higher, like a heart? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. If you have... But it needs to be a straight. Like I have a heart four. It needs to be a straight. Yeah, no, no. It needs to be a straight. Ah, okay. And the end of the straight, so straight means in order.

And it basically says the bus is running every day and then there is just all exceptions that you end up with. There is no bus. And when you make a sequence, you don't include number two. So this is like, if a sequence, this is the biggest one. This is the biggest. Let's say you have this, then nothing can beat this. Okay, yeah. Even you have four, two, or four bears, whatever, doesn't matter. Nothing can beat this? Nothing can beat this. No, nothing. It's a sequence. Yeah, it's a sequence. And then this is the biggest in the sequence. Ah. Okay, yeah. Because it's the ace of hearts. And yes, it's always the biggest. It's a sequence. Yeah, it's a sequence. And this is the biggest in the sequence. Ah. Because it's the ace of hearts. And the ace is always the biggest. It's not like... Because in some card games... No, if one heart... It's the biggest one in this. But this game, number two is the biggest. But number two is not in the sequence. Apart from number two, yeah. Because in some games, ace is either the largest or one, but it's not. That's why I think the game sometimes name duos or two or something. So the three of spades is the lowest card. Yes. Yeah, okay. So like here I have this so I go first. So three of spades goes first. Yes. Basically since we have all the cards in the game. Yeah, so I go first and then we go for the clock circle so then now it's like this guy have very strong card because i have this and this it's very hard to beat me yeah i guess it's also very hard to beat you because you're the one who knows the rules. Well, not true. Oh my god. Yes, you can do that. I skip. That's an option too. Okay, so now what could I do on top of it? You can't. Because I have three aces. Threees yeah basically any any like queen king ace with any of this age with one of these two aces yeah exactly well actually any of them yes yeah right yes but could i do any any any hard color or any no no no no no because you need you need to end in an ace that's higher than the ace of spades. Yeah Okay, that's another constraint. No, no big because you're basically you have to play something higher, right? Yes The definition of higher here is is that the top card is the height? Yes It's the top card that determines the height of the yes true But but I understood the color it's it's either the number or the color is No, the number had to be higher. But since the aces are higher. If the same number, then you go for the suit. But if I have a color that is higher, like a heart? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. If you have... But it needs to be a straight. Like I have a heart four. It needs to be a straight. Yeah, no, no. It needs to be a straight. Ah, okay. And the end of the straight, so straight means in order. Yeah, okay. And the top card of the straight needs to be higher than the top card of this straight so it could only be an ace in this case yes exactly you skip because you have all of them yeah you must skip yeah yeah yeah yeah so let's say even I can choose to skip here so let's suppose you skip and I think of it so the only one that cannot skip is this one. No, I can skip also. You can skip, but you could choose to do something. Yeah, I can choose to do something. So let's suppose you skip, then you go.

No, but if you choose, like if you could see that when it's your turn, then you could actually play because you have a... Yes. And then it's your turn to do and you dictate the play basically. Yes. Right. Yes. Yes. There you go. Just make examples. So now it's basically a different... I saw, okay, okay. Now she, because her turn, she... Okay, but I could have also started something new? No, because... And we need to wait the complete round. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So now you have... Okay. Now you just need 5 to pair bigger than 4. Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, you can choose. It's your turn now. Yeah, okay. Now it's your turn. So here it just picks the pattern. This is interesting. Okay. And I can put more, right? You can put 5 pair num pay ups no you must eat a pair because this is pair four so you put a pair of six six and six i okay i need to take another six are you winning again can i i might take this i also have the heart six could i take three of them cannot, I have to follow the pattern. Okay. Okay. So then I can go, for example, this. This. And it's quite hard because you need to pair up 2. And normally people don't want to get risk to go and pair up 2. It's your turn. Yeah. Aha.

Threees yeah basically any any like queen king ace with any of this age with one of these two aces yeah exactly well actually any of them yes yeah right yes but could i do any any any hard color or any no no no no no because you need you need to end in an ace that's higher than the ace of spades. Yeah Okay, that's another constraint. No, no big because you're basically you have to play something higher, right? Yes The definition of higher here is is that the top card is the height? Yes It's the top card that determines the height of the yes true But but I understood the color it's it's either the number or the color is No, the number had to be higher. But since the aces are higher. If the same number, then you go for the suit. But if I have a color that is higher, like a heart? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. If you have... But it needs to be a straight. Like I have a heart four. It needs to be a straight. Yeah, no, no. It needs to be a straight. Ah, okay. And the end of the straight, so straight means in order. Yeah, okay. And the top card of the straight needs to be higher than the top card of this straight so it could only be an ace in this case yes exactly you skip because you have all of them yeah you must skip yeah yeah yeah yeah so let's say even I can choose to skip here so let's suppose you skip and I think of it so the only one that cannot skip is this one. No, I can skip also. You can skip, but you could choose to do something. Yeah, I can choose to do something. So let's suppose you skip, then you go. And if you want it to be your turn, for example, then you could basically... No, if I skip it, this is like a new turn, so I cannot do anything. No, but if you choose, like if you could see that when it's your turn, then you could actually play because you have a... Yes. And then it's your turn to do and you dictate the play basically. Yes. Right. Yes. Yes. There you go. Just make examples. So now it's basically a different... I saw, okay, okay. Now she, because her turn, she... Okay, but I could have also started something new? No, because... And we need to wait the complete round. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So now you have... Okay. Now you just need 5 to pair bigger than 4. Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, you can choose. It's your turn now. Yeah, okay. Now it's your turn. So here it just picks the pattern. This is interesting. Okay. And I can put more, right? You can put 5 pair num pay ups no you must eat a pair because this is pair four so you put a pair of six six and six i okay i need to take another six are you winning again can i i might take this i also have the heart six could i take three of them cannot, I have to follow the pattern. Okay. Okay. So then I can go, for example, this. This. And it's quite hard because you need to pair up 2. And normally people don't want to get risk to go and pair up 2. It's your turn. Yeah. Aha. Yes. And then... I have a pair of 2, so I can do that. Yes. And I could... No, I would need 4 pairs to beat that right? Yes four back continuously"
Playing Games,1416,1469," then you can have the club to then exactly exactly yes yeah the way to top that a two is with three pairs so they have several X exception if you have four in the row yeah you bit pay up to sorry a bit too okay okay if you have three bears in the row let's say three bear up eight two bear sorry a bear up eight a bear up nine a bear up ten you can pit also two okay yes and if you have two twos like a pair of twos then you need four pairs yes four bears in a row I think these are made by sore losers. These are additions to the rules made by sore losers. I cannot have lost, you know. I have so good cards. There's a rule. And basically that's it, because now we go for the simple version so we don't go for the points. Then apparently there's more. The points are so complicated and that makes the game very interesting. Like all the exceptions you have from schedules. There is actually a mountain hub somewhere in Austria that has a sign like a proper bus stop. And it basically says the bus is running every day and then there is just all exceptions that you end up with. There is no bus. And when you make a sequence, you don't include number two. So this is like, if a sequence, this is the biggest one. This is the biggest. Let's say you have this, then nothing can beat this. Okay, yeah. Even you have four, two, or four bears, whatever, doesn't matter. Nothing can beat this? Nothing can beat this. No, nothing. It's a sequence. Yeah, it's a sequence. And then this is the biggest in the sequence. Ah. Okay, yeah. Because it's the ace of hearts. And yes, it's always the biggest. It's a sequence. Yeah, it's a sequence. And this is the biggest in the sequence. Ah. Because it's the ace of hearts. And the ace is always the biggest. It's not like... Because in some card games... No, if one heart... It's the biggest one in this. But this game, number two is the biggest. But number two is not in the sequence. Apart from number two, yeah. Because in some games, ace is either the largest or one, but it's not. That's why I think the game sometimes name duos or two or something. So the three of spades is the lowest card. Yes. Yeah, okay. So like here I have this so I go first. So three of spades goes first. Yes. Basically since we have all the cards in the game. Yeah, so I go first and then we go for the clock circle so then now it's like this guy have very strong card because i have this and this it's very hard to beat me yeah i guess it's also very hard to beat you because you're the one who knows the rules. Well, not true. Oh my god. Yes, you can do that. I skip. That's an option too. Okay, so now what could I do on top of it? You can't. Because I have three aces. Threees yeah basically any any like queen king ace with any of this age with one of these two aces yeah exactly well actually any of them yes yeah right yes but could i do any any any hard color or any no no no no no because you need you need to end in an ace that's higher than the ace of spades. Yeah Okay, that's another constraint. No, no big because you're basically you have to play something higher, right? Yes The definition of higher here is is that the top card is the height? Yes It's the top card that determines the height of the yes true But but I understood the color it's it's either the number or the color is No, the number had to be higher. But since the aces are higher. If the same number, then you go for the suit. But if I have a color that is higher, like a heart? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. If you have... But it needs to be a straight. Like I have a heart four. It needs to be a straight. Yeah, no, no. It needs to be a straight. Ah, okay. And the end of the straight, so straight means in order. Yeah, okay. And the top card of the straight needs to be higher than the top card of this straight so it could only be an ace in this case yes exactly you skip because you have all of them yeah you must skip yeah yeah yeah yeah so let's say even I can choose to skip here so let's suppose you skip and I think of it so the only one that cannot skip is this one. No, I can skip also. You can skip, but you could choose to do something. Yeah, I can choose to do something. So let's suppose you skip, then you go. And if you want it to be your turn, for example, then you could basically... No, if I skip it, this is like a new turn, so I cannot do anything. No, but if you choose, like if you could see that when it's your turn, then you could actually play because you have a... Yes. And then it's your turn to do and you dictate the play basically. Yes. Right. Yes. Yes. There you go. Just make examples. So now it's basically a different... I saw, okay, okay. Now she, because her turn, she... Okay, but I could have also started something new? No, because... And we need to wait the complete round. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So now you have... Okay. Now you just need 5 to pair bigger than 4. Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, you can choose. It's your turn now. Yeah, okay. Now it's your turn. So here it just picks the pattern. This is interesting. Okay. And I can put more, right? You can put 5 pair num pay ups no you must eat a pair because this is pair four so you put a pair of six six and six i okay i need to take another six are you winning again can i i might take this i also have the heart six could i take three of them cannot, I have to follow the pattern. Okay. Okay. So then I can go, for example, this. This. And it's quite hard because you need to pair up 2. And normally people don't want to get risk to go and pair up 2. It's your turn. Yeah. Aha. Yes. And then... I have a pair of 2, so I can do that. Yes. And I could... No, I would need 4 pairs to beat that right? Yes four back continuously"

So you've got a few hours that you will need to use to record yourself talking. You noted you signed one extra page, right? So it will be fine. You also get to pause the video and add some context whenever you like. It's going to be an appendix, you know. Online one. No, but what is gonna be the standard set that we... Oh, the video stream, timeline. Okay. Are we gonna run some out of patch? We should also make the originals available if somebody wants to actually play with time alignment. But we kind of assume the timelines will be perfect. No. No. Are we going to be releasing them as is? That somebody, that everybody can download them? You will get a chance to um to go through your data and remove something that shouldn't be there but you have to tell Luca who will then remove that short period of time from every video.

No, that's the way I would like to do. But Stefan, I think we should just make it available to everyone. Not really requesting much. You know why I'm asking asking because this is going to be pretty expensive to host anywhere yeah so what how do we maintain that that just in that sentence does a lot of heavy lifting there so just for context yesterday we produced about four terabytes of data um okay this is not something you just want to casually download just to have a look.

No, that's the way I would like to do. But Stefan, I think we should just make it available to everyone. Not really requesting much.

So I think we are going to release the raw footage and then also the Stefan directs cut where you just give commentary over each individual video stream. So you've got a few hours that you will need to use to record yourself talking. You noted you signed one extra page, right? So it will be fine. You also get to pause the video and add some context whenever you like. It's going to be an appendix, you know. Online one. No, but what is gonna be the standard set that we... Oh, the video stream, timeline. Okay. Are we gonna run some out of patch? We should also make the originals available if somebody wants to actually play with time alignment. But we kind of assume the timelines will be perfect. No. No. Are we going to be releasing them as is? That somebody, that everybody can download them? You will get a chance to um to go through your data and remove something that shouldn't be there but you have to tell Luca who will then remove that short period of time from every video.

Yeah. Or people have to kind of register for one of the benchmarks or something? Yeah, maybe a benchmark, but that's not a full demo. Free. You mean don't finish the broth? Yeah, the broth, yes.

No, that's the way I would like to do. But Stefan, I think we should just make it available to everyone. Not really requesting much. You know why I'm asking asking because this is going to be pretty expensive to host anywhere yeah so what how do we maintain that that just in that sentence does a lot of heavy lifting there so just for context yesterday we produced about four terabytes of data um okay this is not something you just want to casually download just to have a look.

"The video segment shows a person in a kitchen preparing food. Therefore, the correct category is **Cooking**.",1926,1932, People with candace just up. But this is a lot of work.
"Let's analyze the image to determine the correct category.

The image shows a person wearing a headlamp, which is often used for activities that require focused light, such as working in a poorly lit area or during tasks that demand attention to detail. The person is also looking at something in their hands, and there are various items in the background that suggest a kitchen or dining area. Specifically, there are dishes on shelves, a countertop with what appears to be a grill or cooking surface, and some food items.

Considering these elements, the most fitting category is **Cooking**. The headlamp suggests the person might be preparing food, possibly in a low-light setting, and the presence of cooking equipment reinforces this.

The final answer is $\boxed{Cooking}$.",1932,1933," This is a very personal thing from their perspective. The extra for me goes into the arms. And they have very tacky, also,-reform things.

"The most fitting category for this segment is **Cooking**.

Here's why:

* **Visible Ingredients:** There are various ingredients like fruits (oranges, bananas), greens, and what appears to be a pineapple, suggesting food preparation.
* **Kitchen Environment:** The scene is set in a kitchen with appliances like a stove and cabinets, a common place for cooking.
* **Tools and Utensils:** We see bowls, a colander, and what looks like a whisk or similar kitchen tool, all indicative of cooking activities.
* **People Engaged:** The individuals in the video appear to be actively involved in tasks that are characteristic of preparing food.

"The most fitting category for this segment is **Leisure Activities**.

Here's why:

*   **Dartboard:** The visible dartboard strongly suggests a game or leisure activity is taking place.
*   **Group Setting:** The presence of multiple people in a living room environment implies a social gathering, which is often associated with leisure.
*   **Relaxed Atmosphere:** The overall ambiance of the room appears relaxed and conducive to recreational pursuits.

While other activities might be occurring concurrently, the visual cues point most strongly to a leisure-based scenario.",903,904," Trips to Thailand. Landmarks must be civic structures.

Okay, so it's in your head. Well, we will get it reconstructed from. Yeah. Ah. Basically, a lot of the dishes are, you start with this, and then essentially once you put the spice in, you fry it a little bit, then you have the curry. It is a concept, something like the sofrito up in Thailand, right? Everything starts with a sofrito. They start with the carrot, onion, and cherry. Do you need to soak the lentils? No, they should be pre-soaked, I hope. Normally they are. The red lentils are usually just put in. Putting instructions to boil, no need to soak. No need to soak, exactly. And then tomato, sweet tomato, normal tomato. Potato, potato sorry potato and also you need passata passata passata tomato yeah I'm gonna make this tomato paste also make it coconut based. Yes, coconut."

"The image shows a kitchen scene with two people. One person is standing near a refrigerator, which has items on it, and the other person is partially visible in the foreground. There are also kitchen cabinets and lighting fixtures visible. The overall impression is that of a domestic setting where activities like cooking or preparing food might take place. Without more specific visual cues about what the people are doing, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact activity. However, ""Cooking"" is a plausible general classification for a kitchen environment.

"The image shows a man standing in a living room. He is wearing a headlamp and appears to be preparing for an activity that requires illumination. The room is furnished with a television, shelves, and a fireplace, suggesting a domestic setting. Without further context or actions depicted, it's challenging to definitively classify the specific activity. However, considering the available options, ""Leisure Activities"" is the most appropriate broad category.
