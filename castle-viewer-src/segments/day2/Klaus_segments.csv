"The image shows a person in what appears to be a bathroom, but the context of the broader scene suggests this is more of a general indoor setting. The person is standing and looking down, possibly at something on the floor or a low surface. There's a sink and toilet visible, indicating a bathroom. However, without more information about what the person is doing or the overall environment, it's difficult to definitively classify the activity.

Given the limited information and the ambiguity of the action, none of the provided categories fit perfectly. However, if we consider the possibility of a quick routine or personal upkeep, ""Washing dishes"" might be loosely interpreted as ""Washing hands"" or a general hygiene activity. But this is a stretch.

Since the prompt requires classification into one of the given categories, and none are a clear fit, it highlights the limitations of classifying based solely on visual cues in this specific instance.

**However, if forced to choose the *least* inappropriate category based on a very general interpretation of being in a bathroom and potentially performing a personal hygiene task:**

*   **Washing dishes** (if interpreted extremely broadly as washing hands/face)

So if you leave them, they're 20't used them... And a queen and a king and they're all ten? No, they're ten, eleven, thirteen, I think. Aha, okay, okay. Maybe, maybe they're all twos. But this one is basically, on the table it's two, on your hand it's twenty-two. Okay, okay. It's good to know. It's good to know. Anyway. Yeah. So I think these are the rules that I can remember. Yeah. There was a glue. There was a glue. We have twins in our village that played this through school and they had a book and they were writing down scores. And they did this months at some point, always keeping track of the scores and it's going up and down normally around zero. Incredible. How many cards to roll? Eight. Two, three. Three, and then two, and then three okay okay okay And there was a if you put down like everything if you close by so not on the first round remember if you close if you close by emptying your hand completely yeah that would give like a 50 bonus points oh yeah i got it yeah and uh you can only put down the same uh type if if there are at least three yeah okay so you can always only put down three three is the minimum okay now now you can draw put down whatever you want okay so and i can also use this white card here right right? Yes, you can. Yeah, perfect. Yeah. Now, for me, as a strategy... And I've also got a wild card here. Okay. For nine. Yeah, and then I say Romy. Yes. All right.

Of course. might get uh you know you might get nine ten you might get the jack here yes yes two wild cards would actually okay right right but in this case okay good it's fun funny game it's a good game you. And it extends nicely to 3-4 people. It's not just a 2 person game. Beyond that you start to run out of cards. The most fun is when you have a big stack and you get everything. everything because then you can even if you lose the game you can sometimes get lots and lots and lots of points. Oh I see, I see.

**Eating**,2631,2680," They requested that we run something that's like BBS or LSE, or BBS and LSE actually, at ACM Multimedia. Get together, figure it out, do it. It has to be interactive. They didn't say that, but since they said it has to be like, it should be like BBS slash LSE, it probably is something with an interactive element to it. Data set release, bit of training data, maybe a closed workshop and a public open session. That is what I think is gonna happen. So looking for something that's not the obvious, release a data, set a date, get people together, run a challenge, hear some topics, Q&A, an ad hoc, and see what happens. That's the default approach. Is there something you want to do that's better or more novel than that? Does anybody have any ideas? Let's worry about the challenge first and the hackathon second, I think. So the question the question is this challenge have to have one single task workshop I might be a little bit of associated workshop and a grand challenge tied to the workshop I was also thinking like I mean given given the bias we'll have in the dataset, there is a lot of research on multimedia for cooking, eating, so basically one task could be to do whatever you have on your dataset and just test it on this dataset. Don't use any training data from this dataset, see how this transfers to new data. And of course, I guess we want to do something like more LSC style interactive queries. I mean, from the backlog of things that we want to do is one thing that we always for VPS also have was trying to see how precisely you phrase queries or how simple you keep the language. There is always this tension between use simple words that everyone understands versus being precise so that might be something also to study but this is of course needs comparison so either you split it up to groups if we have enough participants that's good work but we didn't know in advance probably I think we should like do a hybrid benchmark for everyone to compare them when they create a new idea. But for annual competition, we should like change the task to a new one and motivate to create a new idea how to change the task to a new one and motivate them to create a new idea or change the method to commit with other teams. So yeah, that's my idea. The usual Grand Challenge formats, which I think we should stick to at least for the part that we label as challenge is an asynchronous operation. You get your data, you get your task, you get your time to process, to do whatever it is you think you need to do to solve the task, you send in your results, you get your scores back and there's going to be result presentation of everybody or the top scoring teams depending on the results. So it's not very alike to LSE and VBS? Yeah, I mean this is something we can do on top of this, that we have a session where something happens live. I think that's what they literally asked us. I mean, that's one thing that makes this format very unique, this interaction. And why is it kind of, I think, interesting that we look at, right, some form of interaction in the age of these conversational systems, because these are conversational systems, being from the beginning. So we can do some kind of data mining where they build a system, more like exploration system and then at the challenge we will have very specific questions for that. For example regarding group dynamics, so they will have to build a system that can visualize the group dynamics and show some kind of interaction that more and very user experience space. And then at the challenge, we ask some questions live and they have to use the system to answer that. It's like, who did I talk to the most today or something like that. But these questions are only released at the challenge life Yes, I would just not limit it to something this because the the barrier of entry for these sort of things is very Right. So you need a complete stack I do we should be to be able to do this in try think for us Whereas if you just give out some tasks, people can put some algorithms together however they want. It only needs to run exactly once on whatever resources they might have, and they can produce those results. This might not cover all the things, but it is certainly for some interesting tasks. It might be entirely sufficient that they can build their thing, it runs on whatever they have, it will take a while to run, we'll produce some output, we will look at the output and tell them how well they did. So something that has a low barrier to entry, asynchronous submission, take part in the Grand Challenge, but there is an interactive element to the Grand Challenge, which is to a workshop, which is somehow different than a hackathon. And I guess the hackathon should have all the things we can not evaluate, whereas there either we don't have a ground truth or there cannot be a ground truth because there is some ambiguity in there, whereas the challenges should have a clear mechanism by which you can tell how much of this you got right. We kind of do this with LTCIR, right? That email I send out periodically and everybody ignores it. With FTCIR, where we do have this asynchronous challenge. You build your system, you give it a query, which we've got to look at. We read the queries. The queries are more descriptive than an LSE query. It has a title, a description, and then a narrative that says, oh, eating breakfast is relevant only if it includes burnout. I'll throw some description like that in case it's very, very clear. And people do that in their own time. By a certain date, they submit the runs. We pool all people's runs together and generate a ground truth. We don't evaluate everything. It's not a complete ground truth, it's a pool ground truth."

I mean, from the backlog of things that we want to do is one thing that we always for VPS also have was trying to see how precisely you phrase queries or how simple you keep the language. There is always this tension between use simple words that everyone understands versus being precise so that might be something also to study but this is of course needs comparison so either you split it up to groups if we have enough participants that's good work but we didn't know in advance probably I think we should like do a hybrid benchmark for everyone to compare them when they create a new idea. But for annual competition, we should like change the task to a new one and motivate to create a new idea how to change the task to a new one and motivate them to create a new idea or change the method to commit with other teams. So yeah, that's my idea. The usual Grand Challenge formats, which I think we should stick to at least for the part that we label as challenge is an asynchronous operation. You get your data, you get your task, you get your time to process, to do whatever it is you think you need to do to solve the task, you send in your results, you get your scores back and there's going to be result presentation of everybody or the top scoring teams depending on the results. So it's not very alike to LSE and VBS? Yeah, I mean this is something we can do on top of this, that we have a session where something happens live. I think that's what they literally asked us. I mean, that's one thing that makes this format very unique, this interaction. And why is it kind of, I think, interesting that we look at, right, some form of interaction in the age of these conversational systems, because these are conversational systems, being from the beginning. So we can do some kind of data mining where they build a system, more like exploration system and then at the challenge we will have very specific questions for that. For example regarding group dynamics, so they will have to build a system that can visualize the group dynamics and show some kind of interaction that more and very user experience space. And then at the challenge, we ask some questions live and they have to use the system to answer that. It's like, who did I talk to the most today or something like that. But these questions are only released at the challenge life Yes, I would just not limit it to something this because the the barrier of entry for these sort of things is very Right. So you need a complete stack I do we should be to be able to do this in try think for us Whereas if you just give out some tasks, people can put some algorithms together however they want. It only needs to run exactly once on whatever resources they might have, and they can produce those results. This might not cover all the things, but it is certainly for some interesting tasks. It might be entirely sufficient that they can build their thing, it runs on whatever they have, it will take a while to run, we'll produce some output, we will look at the output and tell them how well they did. So something that has a low barrier to entry, asynchronous submission, take part in the Grand Challenge, but there is an interactive element to the Grand Challenge, which is to a workshop, which is somehow different than a hackathon. And I guess the hackathon should have all the things we can not evaluate, whereas there either we don't have a ground truth or there cannot be a ground truth because there is some ambiguity in there, whereas the challenges should have a clear mechanism by which you can tell how much of this you got right. We kind of do this with LTCIR, right? That email I send out periodically and everybody ignores it. With FTCIR, where we do have this asynchronous challenge. You build your system, you give it a query, which we've got to look at. We read the queries. The queries are more descriptive than an LSE query. It has a title, a description, and then a narrative that says, oh, eating breakfast is relevant only if it includes burnout. I'll throw some description like that in case it's very, very clear. And people do that in their own time. By a certain date, they submit the runs. We pool all people's runs together and generate a ground truth. We don't evaluate everything. It's not a complete ground truth, it's a pool ground truth."

Data set release, bit of training data, maybe a closed workshop and a public open session. That is what I think is gonna happen. So looking for something that's not the obvious, release a data, set a date, get people together, run a challenge, hear some topics, Q&A, an ad hoc, and see what happens. That's the default approach.

There is always this tension between use simple words that everyone understands versus being precise so that might be something also to study but this is of course needs comparison so either you split it up to groups if we have enough participants that's good work but we didn't know in advance probably I think we should like do a hybrid benchmark for everyone to compare them when they create a new idea. But for annual competition, we should like change the task to a new one and motivate to create a new idea how to change the task to a new one and motivate them to create a new idea or change the method to commit with other teams. So yeah, that's my idea. The usual Grand Challenge formats, which I think we should stick to at least for the part that we label as challenge is an asynchronous operation. You get your data, you get your task, you get your time to process, to do whatever it is you think you need to do to solve the task, you send in your results, you get your scores back and there's going to be result presentation of everybody or the top scoring teams depending on the results. So it's not very alike to LSE and VBS? Yeah, I mean this is something we can do on top of this, that we have a session where something happens live. I think that's what they literally asked us. I mean, that's one thing that makes this format very unique, this interaction. And why is it kind of, I think, interesting that we look at, right, some form of interaction in the age of these conversational systems, because these are conversational systems, being from the beginning. So we can do some kind of data mining where they build a system, more like exploration system and then at the challenge we will have very specific questions for that. For example regarding group dynamics, so they will have to build a system that can visualize the group dynamics and show some kind of interaction that more and very user experience space. And then at the challenge, we ask some questions live and they have to use the system to answer that. It's like, who did I talk to the most today or something like that. But these questions are only released at the challenge life Yes, I would just not limit it to something this because the the barrier of entry for these sort of things is very Right. So you need a complete stack I do we should be to be able to do this in try think for us Whereas if you just give out some tasks, people can put some algorithms together however they want. It only needs to run exactly once on whatever resources they might have, and they can produce those results. This might not cover all the things, but it is certainly for some interesting tasks. It might be entirely sufficient that they can build their thing, it runs on whatever they have, it will take a while to run, we'll produce some output, we will look at the output and tell them how well they did. So something that has a low barrier to entry, asynchronous submission, take part in the Grand Challenge, but there is an interactive element to the Grand Challenge, which is to a workshop, which is somehow different than a hackathon. And I guess the hackathon should have all the things we can not evaluate, whereas there either we don't have a ground truth or there cannot be a ground truth because there is some ambiguity in there, whereas the challenges should have a clear mechanism by which you can tell how much of this you got right. We kind of do this with LTCIR, right? That email I send out periodically and everybody ignores it. With FTCIR, where we do have this asynchronous challenge. You build your system, you give it a query, which we've got to look at. We read the queries. The queries are more descriptive than an LSE query. It has a title, a description, and then a narrative that says, oh, eating breakfast is relevant only if it includes burnout. I'll throw some description like that in case it's very, very clear. And people do that in their own time. By a certain date, they submit the runs. We pool all people's runs together and generate a ground truth. We don't evaluate everything. It's not a complete ground truth, it's a pool ground truth."
Sitting,3028,3055," that as well do some interesting interaction with this in App Workshop where the queries are different, like some kind of, really there's this interaction queries. The time I was talking to Ali about the DCR query we hadn't yet released. What was the outcome of that conversation? Those kind of things, much nicer things. And that's really interesting, I think, where I'm interacting with challenges. Not just mind it. But this is a different... This is also somewhat difficult to evaluate because, I mean, we need to phrase this very precisely because what was the outcome of this conversation is not something that has a precise answer. But that's what we do with the judges. The judges make decisions. Yeah, but currently what we have is, like, the judges get something that is a very short answer with some degrees of freedom. But if you ask for outcome of conversation, you could write a paragraph on that. Okay, we limit the... Like we do this with the Q&A things already. What airline? Oh, Turkish Airlines. Or whatever, Turkish. Fine. We do it. We only don't phrase it like that. So basically how the queries in a known item, and I think not in ad hoc, but in a known item, I think are formulated, that's a multi-turn retrieval. If we don't go for a full conversation, but conversational search, for example example that's pretty much how you formulate and evaluate query source you provide a bit of information that people stop looking then it's funny you know on the microphone people say okay nobody finding and then uh typically werner or you kind of says uh additional piece of information you know like that growth running up the hill to the father uh then you provide next bit of information. But what is the target? Is it a pure retrieval task, as in find the end of this conversational chain, for this example? Or is it a, you need to somehow summarize this conversation into two phrases? Evaluating somewhere is super difficult. Yes. I thought most of us did it at some point. Maybe my example was bad. It doesn't necessarily have to be the outcome of a conversation. It can be the outcome of cooking breakfast on the third day. How many croissants were left? Whatever is that kind of query. We make the query so that actually you have a quite good opinion towards the correct or reasonably correct. Yes, but this is an easy fact finding. And then you could either have a pure value as a result, as in, I did something, my answer is 3, I'm not going to tell you how I got it. or you have to actually identify the crosshairs and say well show me all the instances and then I can go oh yeah this one, this is two, this is three. There's actually three at the issue at IV or IVB where one of the teams actually online team the guy was guessing the answers yeah yeah always twice allegedly and very badly very badly so you're moving towards like reasoning yeah but providing evidence yeah that's what the track we did you remember multimedia event detection was yeah yeah that was what they call summarization it was a bit of a blasasko sanoa, että se oli samaristus. Se oli vain tunne. Luulen, että voit mennä muiden tasoihin. Voit vain esitellä ja sanoa, että olen nähnyt niitä asioita kolme kuvia. Tai voit esitellä listan tunneista ja sanoa, että tämä on kuvia, tämä on kuvia. Joo, jos haluat, voit käsitellä sitä. Se on yksi asia. Amen. really provide the list of evidence and say this is the picture this is the picture yeah that's that's asynchronous a meta task was asynchronous yeah i mean you could you could do it in a synchronous thing as well if you have a if you have a system of course if you do that in an interactive way and you have things that that user reasons and the system doesn't know about, then it gets difficult. But at least, I mean, I guess it could be interesting to build a system that also can keep this evidence. So basically that when you provide the answer, you have the things you looked at and say, well, this is the information I used to come up with the answer. I would like to bring an additional aspect to this discussion, because the grand challenge traditionally was always funded by companies and in a way that they also get some output, right? And even though I fully agree with all of you that we need interactive challenges, I think for the grand challenge at ACM Multimedia, we could also maybe do some subtasks like labeling. For example, many people in multimedia are working on food recognition. So it could be a collaborative annotation task also. And then later on, from that collaborative annotation, we could extract metadata and later on maybe use it for the interactive challenges as a ground truth, even though it might not be completely correct, of course. But as a challenge, how do you evaluate it? I mean, the challenge has kind of this competition. Yeah. The hackathon stuff. Yeah, exactly. There's more hackathon. Let me know what came out of that meeting in 18.3 during the first morning. It was a health-based hackathon is what they wanted to do. And we're naturally going to feed into that. I mean, there's some interesting things we can do about this. I mean, for example, all of these things have barcodes on them. Right, right, right. So you can cross-reference this with the international product database and know exactly what this was. And then you can track how much of this happens to be. Right. Good idea. Yes. How much of this was consumed over what amount of time? Very good idea. And, I mean, mean essentially it will be difficult to track who actually consumed what but the the the methodology would be applicable if you have a smaller group of people um for a for a health tracking you can say okay what did i actually eat what are what is my nutritional profile just based on things i've seen this sort of stuff. I think this would be fascinating for hackathons. It would be very difficult for the grand challenge because how do you evaluate this? Because we are not all secretly keeping track. Maybe just one comment to this, because TrackWheat also does this part-based evaluation, right? Where they evaluate with some manual effort 10% of the submissions and then approximate how much there will be in the entire set. For example with product annotations, even 10%. Yeah, it's a lot. You're right. So right yeah some grand challenges if you look at it the way I kind of participated also in some and the one that we won you know New Yorker melange that was that one was brought by IBM and because they were based in New York you know like they wanted really this is definition of Grand Challenge. We want to show in New York using all this wealth of social media data from different perspectives. So competing teams had totally different solutions. Very interesting. Somebody focused on the fashion of the city, you know, like this city of fashion, recommender systems, location recommender systems and so on and so on. So, speaking about the grand challenges, they have also tradition of these open-ended tasks. So, in that sense, what we kind of discussed now as a hackathon could also fit grand challenge. Right. But there the checking wasn't on individual items whether they're correct or not. No, no, no, absolutely not. It was like, what did you make? But this is the more you have a jury that looks at the sort of stuff. Absolutely, yes, yes, yes. The look and the feel of the thing. They essentially grade the creativity and the quality of the output. Presentation also during the conference. Yeah, I mean, this is also something that would be interesting to do but I guess this would be two tracks within something like this, right? The more qualitative versus the more quantitative. Well, in that case there was only the one, right? There was only one track. There was only one track. Because at that time for the community it was really important to see what can we do, everybody talks about this social multimedia wealth and so on, what can we do, let's start moving into building some systems that actually use it for something useful, either tracking fashion trends, Hong Kong people did this, or location recommenders what we did and a few other groups as well and so on and so on and so on. And just like saying here, there are many possibilities. It doesn't have to be really classic computer vision segmentation. No, no, absolutely. We could also track our fashion. Maybe find out who is wearing the same shirt or something. I see you changed. And I changed not to be the same as you, we both changed it."

And, I mean, mean essentially it will be difficult to track who actually consumed what but the the the methodology would be applicable if you have a smaller group of people um for a for a health tracking you can say okay what did i actually eat what are what is my nutritional profile just based on things i've seen this sort of stuff. I think this would be fascinating for hackathons. It would be very difficult for the grand challenge because how do you evaluate this? Because we are not all secretly keeping track. Maybe just one comment to this, because TrackWheat also does this part-based evaluation, right? Where they evaluate with some manual effort 10% of the submissions and then approximate how much there will be in the entire set. For example with product annotations, even 10%. Yeah, it's a lot. You're right. So right yeah some grand challenges if you look at it the way I kind of participated also in some and the one that we won you know New Yorker melange that was that one was brought by IBM and because they were based in New York you know like they wanted really this is definition of Grand Challenge. We want to show in New York using all this wealth of social media data from different perspectives. So competing teams had totally different solutions. Very interesting. Somebody focused on the fashion of the city, you know, like this city of fashion, recommender systems, location recommender systems and so on and so on. So, speaking about the grand challenges, they have also tradition of these open-ended tasks. So, in that sense, what we kind of discussed now as a hackathon could also fit grand challenge. Right. But there the checking wasn't on individual items whether they're correct or not. No, no, no, absolutely not. It was like, what did you make? But this is the more you have a jury that looks at the sort of stuff. Absolutely, yes, yes, yes. The look and the feel of the thing. They essentially grade the creativity and the quality of the output. Presentation also during the conference. Yeah, I mean, this is also something that would be interesting to do but I guess this would be two tracks within something like this, right? The more qualitative versus the more quantitative. Well, in that case there was only the one, right? There was only one track. There was only one track. Because at that time for the community it was really important to see what can we do, everybody talks about this social multimedia wealth and so on, what can we do, let's start moving into building some systems that actually use it for something useful, either tracking fashion trends, Hong Kong people did this, or location recommenders what we did and a few other groups as well and so on and so on and so on. And just like saying here, there are many possibilities. It doesn't have to be really classic computer vision segmentation. No, no, absolutely. We could also track our fashion. Maybe find out who is wearing the same shirt or something. I see you changed. And I changed not to be the same as you, we both changed it."

The other options are not as directly supported by the visual information.",3115,3220," that as well do some interesting interaction with this in App Workshop where the queries are different, like some kind of, really there's this interaction queries. The time I was talking to Ali about the DCR query we hadn't yet released. What was the outcome of that conversation? Those kind of things, much nicer things. And that's really interesting, I think, where I'm interacting with challenges. Not just mind it. But this is a different... This is also somewhat difficult to evaluate because, I mean, we need to phrase this very precisely because what was the outcome of this conversation is not something that has a precise answer. But that's what we do with the judges. The judges make decisions. Yeah, but currently what we have is, like, the judges get something that is a very short answer with some degrees of freedom. But if you ask for outcome of conversation, you could write a paragraph on that. Okay, we limit the... Like we do this with the Q&A things already. What airline? Oh, Turkish Airlines. Or whatever, Turkish. Fine. We do it. We only don't phrase it like that. So basically how the queries in a known item, and I think not in ad hoc, but in a known item, I think are formulated, that's a multi-turn retrieval. If we don't go for a full conversation, but conversational search, for example example that's pretty much how you formulate and evaluate query source you provide a bit of information that people stop looking then it's funny you know on the microphone people say okay nobody finding and then uh typically werner or you kind of says uh additional piece of information you know like that growth running up the hill to the father uh then you provide next bit of information. But what is the target? Is it a pure retrieval task, as in find the end of this conversational chain, for this example? Or is it a, you need to somehow summarize this conversation into two phrases? Evaluating somewhere is super difficult. Yes. I thought most of us did it at some point. Maybe my example was bad. It doesn't necessarily have to be the outcome of a conversation. It can be the outcome of cooking breakfast on the third day. How many croissants were left? Whatever is that kind of query. We make the query so that actually you have a quite good opinion towards the correct or reasonably correct. Yes, but this is an easy fact finding. And then you could either have a pure value as a result, as in, I did something, my answer is 3, I'm not going to tell you how I got it. or you have to actually identify the crosshairs and say well show me all the instances and then I can go oh yeah this one, this is two, this is three. There's actually three at the issue at IV or IVB where one of the teams actually online team the guy was guessing the answers yeah yeah always twice allegedly and very badly very badly so you're moving towards like reasoning yeah but providing evidence yeah that's what the track we did you remember multimedia event detection was yeah yeah that was what they call summarization it was a bit of a blasasko sanoa, että se oli samaristus. Se oli vain tunne. Luulen, että voit mennä muiden tasoihin. Voit vain esitellä ja sanoa, että olen nähnyt niitä asioita kolme kuvia. Tai voit esitellä listan tunneista ja sanoa, että tämä on kuvia, tämä on kuvia. Joo, jos haluat, voit käsitellä sitä. Se on yksi asia. Amen. really provide the list of evidence and say this is the picture this is the picture yeah that's that's asynchronous a meta task was asynchronous yeah i mean you could you could do it in a synchronous thing as well if you have a if you have a system of course if you do that in an interactive way and you have things that that user reasons and the system doesn't know about, then it gets difficult. But at least, I mean, I guess it could be interesting to build a system that also can keep this evidence. So basically that when you provide the answer, you have the things you looked at and say, well, this is the information I used to come up with the answer. I would like to bring an additional aspect to this discussion, because the grand challenge traditionally was always funded by companies and in a way that they also get some output, right? And even though I fully agree with all of you that we need interactive challenges, I think for the grand challenge at ACM Multimedia, we could also maybe do some subtasks like labeling. For example, many people in multimedia are working on food recognition. So it could be a collaborative annotation task also. And then later on, from that collaborative annotation, we could extract metadata and later on maybe use it for the interactive challenges as a ground truth, even though it might not be completely correct, of course. But as a challenge, how do you evaluate it? I mean, the challenge has kind of this competition. Yeah. The hackathon stuff. Yeah, exactly. There's more hackathon. Let me know what came out of that meeting in 18.3 during the first morning. It was a health-based hackathon is what they wanted to do. And we're naturally going to feed into that. I mean, there's some interesting things we can do about this. I mean, for example, all of these things have barcodes on them. Right, right, right. So you can cross-reference this with the international product database and know exactly what this was. And then you can track how much of this happens to be. Right. Good idea. Yes. How much of this was consumed over what amount of time? Very good idea.

Where they evaluate with some manual effort 10% of the submissions and then approximate how much there will be in the entire set. For example with product annotations, even 10%. Yeah, it's a lot. You're right. So right yeah some grand challenges if you look at it the way I kind of participated also in some and the one that we won you know New Yorker melange that was that one was brought by IBM and because they were based in New York you know like they wanted really this is definition of Grand Challenge. We want to show in New York using all this wealth of social media data from different perspectives. So competing teams had totally different solutions. Very interesting. Somebody focused on the fashion of the city, you know, like this city of fashion, recommender systems, location recommender systems and so on and so on. So, speaking about the grand challenges, they have also tradition of these open-ended tasks. So, in that sense, what we kind of discussed now as a hackathon could also fit grand challenge. Right. But there the checking wasn't on individual items whether they're correct or not. No, no, no, absolutely not. It was like, what did you make? But this is the more you have a jury that looks at the sort of stuff. Absolutely, yes, yes, yes. The look and the feel of the thing. They essentially grade the creativity and the quality of the output. Presentation also during the conference. Yeah, I mean, this is also something that would be interesting to do but I guess this would be two tracks within something like this, right? The more qualitative versus the more quantitative. Well, in that case there was only the one, right? There was only one track. There was only one track. Because at that time for the community it was really important to see what can we do, everybody talks about this social multimedia wealth and so on, what can we do, let's start moving into building some systems that actually use it for something useful, either tracking fashion trends, Hong Kong people did this, or location recommenders what we did and a few other groups as well and so on and so on and so on. And just like saying here, there are many possibilities. It doesn't have to be really classic computer vision segmentation. No, no, absolutely. We could also track our fashion. Maybe find out who is wearing the same shirt or something. I see you changed. And I changed not to be the same as you, we both changed it."

In this space, can I process the data, can I process 24 queries or whatever we decide to do, send in results, prove relevant judgments, submission back, whether the answer is back, results back. And those that want to do the interactive element will come to the actual conference definitely, right? And they will take part in an interactive grant challenge, which is part of the conference. That's why they asked us to do it right? They wanted the DBS and the LSE in the study. And they need more interaction. Like we forgot that one. Like that was the thing multi-modality agents interaction that's like basically three points. So if we take it back to the simplest thing there's a ad hoc and there's a Q&A session. And then we need to do a synchronous challenge which is ad hoc and Q&A, maybe something else thrown in there, people know well in advance. And that's the first year.

"The most fitting category for this image is **Eating**. 

Here's why:

* **Table setting:** The table is laden with plates, food, and drinks, suggesting a meal is in progress.
* **People's actions:** Several people are seated at the table, and their postures and focus suggest they are consuming food and engaging in conversation related to the meal.
* **Food items:** The presence of pastries, juice cartons, and other food items further supports the classification of eating.",796,826," advertisement state of the advertisements in public space it's kind of you have to pay a tax to put anything in a public space as an advertisement.

And we kind of also organize it as a competition. Competition, you know, meaning that Shepard is gonna be guiding the team. You see where I'm going, helping them make the best out of what they want, not really telling them what to do. But kind of trying to squeeze, I see some fronds, probably not a good idea. I was thinking, well, let's say Werner takes team A from Tsinghua Kajal takes a theme from... Oh, you're doing it like some American Idol or something? Yeah, something like that, why not? It's an interesting approach. I like the idea. I'm a bit worried about its implementation because many people on the disabled are going to be very busy these days especially during the time of that hackathon yeah um we don't have any actually half people here won't have any spare time during that hackathon actually you won't either yeah yeah yeah well to be fair because it's gonna be in a weekend we should we should ideally have some some time during the hackathon because if we are busy running around then something might be wrong. In most cases, it's the general chairs that will be busy handing out whiskies and stuff. So you guys should actually have an enjoyable. Yeah. But I guess before the hackathon it could be in the preparation phase. It could be a light involvement. And yeah, I guess someone needs to be there anyway during the hackathon. So I think this shepherding idea could work. I'm not sure because you said putting it more like a competition.

Sitting,1540,1541," what do we agree on the grand challenge? I'm still not sure. Grand challenge was interactive. So, as a bonus task was interactive. Interactive was going to be some more nighttime and ad hoc. We have to at least get two years out of the data set before making the work. I think that's good. Yeah, you're on longer. Yeah. With bigger SD cards. With bigger, more everything. I think this is something that is on the agenda for later in the week to see what, if we had infinite time and infinite money. Well, this was done on a massive budget. That's why we're at the end of the world. We had done this and we said, we're going to short drive, access to more facilities goes by, we're going to double the price. We had a rough envelope of 10,000. Yes, and I mean, these things are nice. They're not... If we had designed this from scratch, this would look different. Then I would have had 20,000. We have to have these.

**Eating**,1751,1972," from here so and then it could later go to the VPS and LSE but for the first time next year it will be at ac multimedia into one of those yeah possible um which which makes the uh the communication to the people reasonably easy i think what we what we might want to do anyway is just write a brief if you have never heard of vps and lc this is how it works kind of document, which we're missing anyway. So onboarding for new teams is hard because you essentially have to chronologically read a decade of publications to see how the stuff actually works. But that would be the interactive one. And then there's a bunch of logistics we need to figure out, but this is essentially just work. So this is not difficult. And for a non-interactive, we could do almost the same tasks, but asynchronously. Yes. Plus more stuff. So some of the things that we've said that we can actually evaluate that are different type of tasks, as in reconstruct this view from this point. So I i actually took the picture but i'm not showing you the picture um also point of view like uh region of interest slash salient objects or eye gaze from another person that might be difficult to evaluate because we don't have the ground truth yeah so this is more of a hackathon kind of thing yeah or because there we it for users. Because there we can look at it and see if it is reasonable, but if two teams submit something similar, we don't have a precise metric to see how good is this. Because otherwise somebody would actually need to have the eye drop. So this would be the... So definitely the question on the instance retrieval stuff in both tracks. Yeah. And the non-interactive would have additional tracks for reconstruction-y things that you could not reasonably do interactively. That also would not necessarily need human input because it's more of an algorithm. Like recipes or something that we could find. Yes, regenerate this recipe, regenerate this schedule for this person. Count the number of this person or on this day this kind of action was performed right this is the sort of thing this is I mean this is still sort of kind of question answering mm-hmm I would really want to do the visual reconstruction thing for it also so the computer vision people also have an interesting task things like that so just thinking about the reconstruction maybe something we should do while you're here is taking measurements of all the rooms as a grand trees yes well I mean I might get measuring tape Friday morning Kapal, that must be, if they were selling it, there must be a floor plan.

Reading,1345,1498," Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart. Silently, in a dream, she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its loose brown grave-clothes giving off an odor of wax and rosewood, her breasts that had bent upon him mute, reproachful, a faint odor of wetted ashes. Across the Treadsburg Huff Edge, he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the well-fed voice beside him the ring of pay and skyline had a dull green mass of liquid a pile of white china had stood beside her despot holding the green sluggish pile while she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting. Pack Mulligan wiped again his razor plate. Ah, poor dog's body, he said in a kind voice. I must give you a shirt and a few nose rracks. How are the second-hand pricks? They fit well enough, Stephen answered. Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip. The mockery of it, he said contentedly, second-legged they should be. God knows what proxy-bousy left them off. I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe, gray. You look spiffing in them. I'm not joking, Kinch. You look damn well when you're dressed. Thanks, Stephen said. I can't wear them if they are gray. He can't wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in a mirror. Etiquette is etiquette. He kills his mother, but he can't wear grey trousers. He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin. Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smoke-blue mobile eyes. That fellow I was with in the ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, says you have a GPI. He's up in Dottieville with Connolly Norman. General paralysis of the insane. He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea. His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white, glittering teeth."

Who chose this face for me, this dog's body to rid of vermin? It asks me too. I pinched it out of the skivvy room, Buck Mulligan said. It does her all right. The aunt always keeps pain-looking servants for Mulligan. Lead him not into temptation. And her name is Ursula. Loving again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen's peering eyes. The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in the mirror, he said. If wild were only alive to see you. Drawing back and pointing, Stevens said with bitterness, It is a symbol of Irish art, the cracked looking glass of a servant.

It's not fair to ease you like that, Kinch, is it? He said kindly. God knows you have more spirit than any of them. Bear it again. He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of this. The cold steel pen. The camera will not be able to see what you're reading though. Okay that's why I read it out loud.

Cranely's arm, his arm. And to think of your having to pack from these swine. I am the only one that knows what you are. Why don't you trust me more? What have you up your nose against me? It is Heinz. Is it Heinz? If he makes any noise here, I'll bring down Seymour and we will give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Camptorpe. Young shouts of the mooned voices in Clive Camptorpe's rooms. Pale faces, they hold their ribs with laughter. One clasping another. Oh, I shall expire. I shall expire. Break the news to her gently. Aubrey. I shall die. With slit ribbons of his shirt Whipping the air He hops and hovers"

Here's why:

*   **People interacting in a living room setting:** The presence of a couch, coffee table, and fireplace suggests a relaxed environment.
*   **Casual attire:** The individuals are dressed casually.
*   **Potential for games or general socializing:** While not explicitly clear, the setting and relaxed atmosphere are conducive to leisure activities.

But some people, when they eat noodles, they just finish the noodles and that's it. You look like this. Okay, soon. But Stefan, I think we should just make it available to everyone. Not really request too much. You know why I'm asking? Because this is going to be pretty expensive to host anywhere. Yeah. So how are we going to maintain that? That just in that sentence does a lot of heavy lifting there. So just for context, yesterday we produced about 4 terabytes of data."
Sitting,1225,1357," I can tell the difference. I you want to annotate it. For a basic set, you probably already have in mind what we are going to be doing. So I think we're going to release you know the raw footage and then also the Stefan director's cut where you just give commentary over each individual video stream. So you know you've got a few hours that you need to you know. You don't need to do one extra takes right? You also get to pause the video and add some context whenever you like. Oh, thank you. It's going to be an appendix, you know. Online one. Thanks. No, but what is going to be the summer set that we... All the video streams, time all that. Okay. Are we going to run some off-patches? We should also make the originals available if somebody wants to actually play with time alignment. Yep. Well we kind of assumed the time alignment would be perfect. No. No. Are we gonna be releasing them as is? That the time alignment will happen before we... We will get a chance to go through your data and remove something that shouldn't be there. But you have to tell Luca who will then remove that short period of time from everybody's video. We're not sure how to do it yet. That's not how I'm asking. I have those in mind. You know what I'm asking? I'm asking more? Are we going to be kind of allowing everybody to download it? Yeah. Or people have to kind of reduce it to a bunch of apps or something?

Talking,1357,1494," Yeah. No. So what I intend to do is give you a file that has... Once the streams are time aligned you you get like a four by four um boxed thing with all the 15 streams um concurrently we could actually do an mp4 container with all different streams as elementary streams. You want to be able to look at all of them right so um just a a 4x4 video mosaic kind of thing probably probably even in a time-lapse version so you can just look at this. Oh you mean for browsing? Yeah. We need a 16k screen. No, it's going to be down-dressed. So this will help you identify... Sorry Luca, but we should hear the audio. How can we hear 16K? You just need to turn them down and then mix. I can down-mix all the audio. Audio is difficult. To see about things, I can also give you 16 audio channels and then you can talk between them. We'll have to figure this out. But this is essentially going to be an index to help you to identify things you might want to have a close to market and then you can have the original of that. one maybe and then and this could be an mp4 container right this is a different elementary streams and different audio streams i'm not sure that's easy to handle for many people well no maybe not probably not gonna build video containers with multiple video streams because There's... Play it... well... Not sure if..."
Discussing,1494,1498," Can we host it somewhere that people can view it entering a website? I like this. It's huge. Scrooge, that's what I asked. Just pragmatically. It fits on a $200 hard drive. It's not a massive part. No it doesn't. The whole thing, well the whole thing, the whole thing doesn't fit though. You can send the hard drives by mail if you want. That's back 20 years ago we did that. And I remember getting your hard drive from... You would be either getting drive and we got it and Because it raises the schedules for the rest of the day. Why would you want the streams down scale to spice one well for a preview no track with 2006 that was even a degree it would be very soon for Kelly great a little okay screen yes okay I'll be super I will take your words like it it's like security camera yes security guards watching what's going on in the house. You have to get an overview of what's going on. 4x4 is nice. And then some cameras will go off when you take a break and come back. And then they'll come back again. Probably also for direction. And all the audio mixed into one big ramble. The audio? What will be the audio? Probably not for processing. The 4x4 video, what will the audio be? Or will there be no audio? We'll have to see. For that, I can do a down mix and then I can also give you the separate channels. Because separate audio channels is much easier. And mixed channels. Yeah, that would be good. Probably the mixed channel is going to be a little bit less because time alignment, yeah. Then you need a really precise time. Even if I do frame level time alignment, which is the most precise thing that would be possible. Audio is still going to be echoey and messy if you mix all of that. We'll have to see. There's a business opportunity in having cameras that are linked to each other with perfectly aligned audio for such events. The other thing you could do is... What's your budget for a special audio scene? Hands on Phoebe. Now Carl, I think this is actually physically impossible because of the speed of sound yeah no I mean the date that timestamps on the cameras are properly aligned by the camera stop feature yeah yes but this we can do with well yeah not not not to that level right right if you know the way I have a mismatch but I have a 20 millisecond resolution. At best. Anything more precise than that? I mean technically through the audio stream you could be more precise than that but then things start to get really complicated. I mean actually the perfect thing that you would want to do is recreate the spatial audio scene as a spatial audio file and then render it down for a particular listener position. I mean that could be a hackathon. That could be a VR smart... Spatial audio... You could stand... I mean we could probably generate a very good point cloud from all the video streams. Yes, definitely. I mean, there's a lot of interesting spatial audio that happens with this. For electroacoustics, how much the bodies absorb in us. For the next one, I would even want to have in aural recording. So you actually have not only what did I see, but also what did I hear. No, not no no no no no no no but let's see what let's see what the budget is for castle too let's make castle one work first yeah we're now mentioning what we should do and how much work it takes we don't have to think then of some european grants for this and i think this is yeah Yeah, so new. Exactly. To get some of the... Mums ir ļoti daudz darba.

So, that might be interesting. Yeah, yeah, that's on the draft, we need it. Are we good with these calls? Not decided yet? Well, there is a thing in the draft work program that I've seen that talks about the virtual world partnership, which is not there yet, which I don't. I'm not sure it's there yet. I'm not sure if the budget they calculated is already assuming. But we'll see. OK. And Luca, you checked out other data sets before, right? Other similar data sets. You found one you said. There are first-person data sets, first-person video data sets for various things. The most notable ones that have overlap with what we're doing is Epic Kitchens."

"The image appears to show a display cabinet with various decorative items like vases and candles. In the background, a hallway is visible with a door. Given the items in the cabinet, it's most likely that the category is related to **Leisure Activities** (e.g., collecting or displaying decorative items) or perhaps a more general classification if none of the specific activities fit. However, without more context, it's hard to determine a precise activity.

Since I must choose from the provided categories, and none perfectly fit ""displaying decorative items"", I will consider what kind of activity this might be associated with.

"The most appropriate category for this image is **Leisure Activities**. 

Here's why:

* **The grid:** The prominent grid on the refrigerator likely represents a game score or a tracker for some form of competition or organized activity.
* **The notes:** The handwritten notes could be related to planning or reviewing the game, or perhaps a to-do list associated with a leisure pursuit.
* **Overall context:** The image depicts a domestic setting, and the items on display suggest an engagement in a recreational activity rather than a chore or a work-related task.

"The most fitting category for this image is **Cooking**.

Here's why:

*   **Visible cooking activity:** The people in the image are gathered around a stove, with one person holding a tray of food that appears to be in or just out of the oven. There are also baked goods on a cooling rack.
*   **Kitchen environment:** The setting is clearly a kitchen, with appliances, countertops, and cooking utensils visible.
*   **Headlamps:** The headlamps suggest an activity where visibility might be important, which is common in some forms of cooking or culinary challenges.",742,743," Now. Thank you.

"Based on the visual evidence in the provided images, the most fitting category is **Cooking**.

Here's why:

*   **Food Preparation:** The images show a cluttered kitchen counter with various food items, vegetables (like chopped lettuce), and cooking utensils (knives, cutting boards, pots). This strongly suggests that food is being prepared.
*   **Cooking Appliances/Utensils:** Pots are visible on the stove and on a drying rack, and other cooking implements are laid out.
*   **People Engaged:** While not everyone's activity is fully clear, the presence of people in what appears to be a kitchen setting, with the visible food preparation elements, points towards cooking activities.",2961,2963," That one is going back to us.

"Based on the image provided, the most fitting classification is **Cooking**.

Here's why:

*   **Pots and Pans:** There are several pots and pans visible, some appearing to have food in them or having just been used.
*   **Ingredients and Utensils:** Scattered around the counters are what appear to be food items, chopping boards, knives, and other cooking utensils.
*   **Kitchen Environment:** The scene is clearly set in a kitchen, a primary location for cooking.
