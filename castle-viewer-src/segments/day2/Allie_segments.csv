*   **Food and drinks are visible:** Although the food itself isn't the main focus, there are items on the table that suggest consumption.
*   **People appear to be engaged in a meal:** Their postures and the presence of utensils (implied) point towards eating.
*   **Head-mounted devices are present:** While not directly related to eating, these devices might be part of a game or activity occurring during the meal, which is still centered around the act of eating.",2608,2622,

Sitting,2694,2815," they requested that we run something that's like VBS or LSE or VBS and LSE actually at ACM Multimedia Get together figure it out do it. It has to be interactive They didn't say that but since I said it has to be like it should be like VBS and LSE It probably is something with an interactive element to it Data set released bit of data, maybe a closed workshop and a public open session. That is what I think is gonna happen. So looking for something that's not the obvious, release a a data set, set a date, get people together, run a challenge, give some topics, Q&A and ad hoc and see what happens. That's the default approach. Is there something you want to do that's better or more novel than that? Does anybody have any ideas? Let's worry about the challenge first and the hackathon second, I think is, does the challenge have to have one single task or could it be multiple ones? It's up to us. There's a workshop and I imagine there will be an associated workshop and a grand challenge tied to the workshop. I vote multiple. I mean, I was also thinking like, I mean, given the bias we'll have in the data set, there is a lot of research on multimedia for cooking, eating. So basically one task would be basically do whatever you have on your data set and just test it on this data set. Don't use any training data from from this dataset. See how this transfers to new data. And of course, I guess we want to do something like more, more LSC style interactive queries. I mean, from the backlog of things that we want to do is one thing that we always, for VBS also, was trying to see how precisely you phrase queries or how simple you keep the language. There is always this tension between you simple words that everyone understands versus being precise. So might be something also to study but this is of course needs comparison so either you split it up to groups if we have enough participants that would work but we didn't know in advance probably I think we should like build a hybrid benchmark for everyone to compare their manual when they create a new idea. But for annual competitions, we should like change the task to a new one and motivate them to create a new idea or train their method to compete with other teams. So yeah, that's my idea. The usual Grand Challenge format, which I think we should stick to at least for the part that we label as a challenge, is an asynchronous operation. You get your data, you get your task, you get your time to process, to do whatever it is you think you need to do to solve the task, you send in your results, you get your scores back, and there's going to be result presentation of everybody or the top scoring teams depending on it's not very alike to lse and vbs yeah i mean this is it doesn't have to be live we can do on top of this that we have a that we have a session where something happens live. But I would definitely..."

That's one thing that makes this format very unique, this interaction. And why is it kind of, I think, interesting that we look at, right, some form of interaction in the age of these conversational systems, because these are conversational systems, we've been through in the beginning. So we can do some kind of data mining where they build a system of more like exploration system and then at the challenge we will have very specific questions for that for example like regarding group dynamics so they will have to build a system that can visualize the group dynamics and show some kind of interaction that more and very user experience based. And then at the challenge we do, we ask some question live and they have to use the system to answer that. It's like, who did I talk to the most today or something like that.

So we can do some kind of data mining where they build a system of more like exploration system and then at the challenge we will have very specific questions for that for example like regarding group dynamics so they will have to build a system that can visualize the group dynamics and show some kind of interaction that more and very user experience based. And then at the challenge we do, we ask some question live and they have to use the system to answer that. It's like, who did I talk to the most today or something like that.

Unclear,3174,3175," It has a title, a description, and then a narrative that says, oh, eating breakfast is relevant only if it includes Werner. It does some description like that. It makes it very, very clear. And people do that in their own time. By a certain date, they submit the runs. We pool all people's runs together and generate a ground truth. We don't evaluate everything. It's not a complete ground truth. It's a pooled ground truth. So it's never going to be perfect but it's going to be sufficient to differentiate systems. That we can do in a lot of other, okay, that's simple, we do that already. The challenge here is that it's probably a bit more difficult data to work with but that's great. Then we can do some really interesting interactive things in a workshop where the queries are different, like some kind really this this interaction queries that we have so the time i was talking to ali about the ntcr queries you hadn't yet released interactions what was the outcome of that conversation those kind of things much nicer things to do and that's really interesting i think for an interactive challenge not just, but answer it. But this is a different... This is also somewhat difficult to evaluate, because you need to phrase this very precisely, because what was the outcome of this conversation is not something that has a precise answer. But that's what we do with the judges, right? The judges make decisions in these systems. Yeah, but currently what we have is like the judges get something that is a very short answer with some degrees of freedom. But if you like ask for outcome of a conversation, you could write a paragraph on that. Yeah, okay. We limit the... Like we do this with the Q&A things already. What airline? Oh, Turkish Airlines. Or whatever, Turkish. Fine they're both okay. Kahal, we do it. We only don't phrase it like that. So basically how the queries in a known item and I think not in ad hoc, but in a known item I think are formulated, that's multi-term retrieval. If we don't go for a full conversation but conversational search for example, that's pretty much how you formulate and evaluate query sorting. You provide a bit of information, then people stop looking, then it's funny, you know, on the microphone people say, okay, nobody finding, and then typically Werner or you kind of says, aha, additional piece of information, you know. Like that girl running up the hill with her father towards the flag. Then you provide the bit of information but what is what is the target is it a pure retrieval task as in find the end of this conversational tape for this example or is it or is it a easier you need to somehow summarize this conversation into two phrases uh evaluating summer is super difficult i uh but outcomes most of us did it at some time. Maybe my example was bad. It doesn't necessarily have to be the outcome of a conversation. It can be the outcome of cooking breakfast on the third day. How many croissants were left? Whatever is that kind of query, right? We make the query something that actually you can identify and you can be pretty sure is correct or reasonably correct. Yes, but this is an easy fact-finding. And then you could either have a pure value as a result, as in I did something, my answer is three, I'm not going to tell you how I got it, or you have to actually the crosshairs and say well show me all the all the instances and then I can go oh yeah this is one this is two this is three. The issue at IV or 4B where one of the teams actually on an honest team the guessing the answers. Yeah, yeah. And he guessed it right twice. Allegedly. So you're moving towards like reasoning. Yeah, exactly. Providing evidence. Yeah. That's what TrackFit did, you remember? Multimedia Event Detection was? Yeah. And that was what they call summarizationization it was a bit of a blasphemy to call it a stammalization because it was just evidence yeah exactly, I mean I guess you can get to multiple levels you can just provide an explanation and say because I have seen those things on three pictures that's how I can, or you really provide a list of evidence and say this is the picture, this is the picture yeah you can provide the timestamp That's asynchronous then right? Metatask was asynchronous yeah I mean you could you could do it in a synchronous thing as well if you have if you have the system doing it of course if you do that in an interactive way and you have things that the user reasoned and the system doesn't know about, then it gets difficult. But at least, I mean, I guess it could be interesting to build a system that also can keep this evidence. So basically, that when you provide the answer, you have the things you looked at and say, well, this is the information i used to come up with the answer i would like to bring an additional aspect to this discussion uh because the the grand challenge traditionally was always funded by companies and in a way that they also get some output right and even though i fully agree with all of you that we need interactive challenges I think for the grand challenge at ACM multimedia we could also maybe do some subtasks like labeling for example many people in multimedia are working on food recognition so it could be a collaborative annotation task also and then later on on from that collaborative annotation we could extract metadata and later on maybe use it for the interactive challenges as a ground truth, even though it might not be completely correct, of course. But as a challenge, if you put it as a challenge, how do you evaluate it? I mean, the challenge has kind of this competition character. Is that the hackathon stuff? Yeah exactly. Looking at what came out of that meeting in HTML2 Media on the first morning it was a health-based hackathon that's what they wanted to do and we're naturally gonna feed into that if we use this data. I mean there's some very interesting things we can we can do about this I mean for example all of these things have barcodes on them. So you can cross-reference this with the international product database and know exactly what this was and then you can track how much of this happens to be fresh milk by apple green. How much of this was consumed over what amount of time. And essentially mean, essentially, it will be difficult to track who actually consumed what."

Maybe my example was bad. It doesn't necessarily have to be the outcome of a conversation. It can be the outcome of cooking breakfast on the third day. How many croissants were left? Whatever is that kind of query, right? We make the query something that actually you can identify and you can be pretty sure is correct or reasonably correct. Yes, but this is an easy fact-finding. And then you could either have a pure value as a result, as in I did something, my answer is three, I'm not going to tell you how I got it, or you have to actually the crosshairs and say well show me all the all the instances and then I can go oh yeah this is one this is two this is three. The issue at IV or 4B where one of the teams actually on an honest team the guessing the answers. Yeah, yeah. And he guessed it right twice. Allegedly. So you're moving towards like reasoning. Yeah, exactly. Providing evidence. Yeah. That's what TrackFit did, you remember? Multimedia Event Detection was? Yeah. And that was what they call summarizationization it was a bit of a blasphemy to call it a stammalization because it was just evidence yeah exactly, I mean I guess you can get to multiple levels you can just provide an explanation and say because I have seen those things on three pictures that's how I can, or you really provide a list of evidence and say this is the picture, this is the picture yeah you can provide the timestamp That's asynchronous then right? Metatask was asynchronous yeah I mean you could you could do it in a synchronous thing as well if you have if you have the system doing it of course if you do that in an interactive way and you have things that the user reasoned and the system doesn't know about, then it gets difficult. But at least, I mean, I guess it could be interesting to build a system that also can keep this evidence. So basically, that when you provide the answer, you have the things you looked at and say, well, this is the information i used to come up with the answer i would like to bring an additional aspect to this discussion uh because the the grand challenge traditionally was always funded by companies and in a way that they also get some output right and even though i fully agree with all of you that we need interactive challenges I think for the grand challenge at ACM multimedia we could also maybe do some subtasks like labeling for example many people in multimedia are working on food recognition so it could be a collaborative annotation task also and then later on on from that collaborative annotation we could extract metadata and later on maybe use it for the interactive challenges as a ground truth, even though it might not be completely correct, of course. But as a challenge, if you put it as a challenge, how do you evaluate it? I mean, the challenge has kind of this competition character. Is that the hackathon stuff? Yeah exactly. Looking at what came out of that meeting in HTML2 Media on the first morning it was a health-based hackathon that's what they wanted to do and we're naturally gonna feed into that if we use this data. I mean there's some very interesting things we can we can do about this I mean for example all of these things have barcodes on them. So you can cross-reference this with the international product database and know exactly what this was and then you can track how much of this happens to be fresh milk by apple green. How much of this was consumed over what amount of time. And essentially mean, essentially, it will be difficult to track who actually consumed what."
Eating,3315,3522," It has a title, a description, and then a narrative that says, oh, eating breakfast is relevant only if it includes Werner. It does some description like that. It makes it very, very clear. And people do that in their own time. By a certain date, they submit the runs. We pool all people's runs together and generate a ground truth. We don't evaluate everything. It's not a complete ground truth. It's a pooled ground truth. So it's never going to be perfect but it's going to be sufficient to differentiate systems. That we can do in a lot of other, okay, that's simple, we do that already. The challenge here is that it's probably a bit more difficult data to work with but that's great. Then we can do some really interesting interactive things in a workshop where the queries are different, like some kind really this this interaction queries that we have so the time i was talking to ali about the ntcr queries you hadn't yet released interactions what was the outcome of that conversation those kind of things much nicer things to do and that's really interesting i think for an interactive challenge not just, but answer it. But this is a different... This is also somewhat difficult to evaluate, because you need to phrase this very precisely, because what was the outcome of this conversation is not something that has a precise answer. But that's what we do with the judges, right? The judges make decisions in these systems. Yeah, but currently what we have is like the judges get something that is a very short answer with some degrees of freedom. But if you like ask for outcome of a conversation, you could write a paragraph on that. Yeah, okay. We limit the... Like we do this with the Q&A things already. What airline? Oh, Turkish Airlines. Or whatever, Turkish. Fine they're both okay. Kahal, we do it. We only don't phrase it like that. So basically how the queries in a known item and I think not in ad hoc, but in a known item I think are formulated, that's multi-term retrieval. If we don't go for a full conversation but conversational search for example, that's pretty much how you formulate and evaluate query sorting. You provide a bit of information, then people stop looking, then it's funny, you know, on the microphone people say, okay, nobody finding, and then typically Werner or you kind of says, aha, additional piece of information, you know. Like that girl running up the hill with her father towards the flag. Then you provide the bit of information but what is what is the target is it a pure retrieval task as in find the end of this conversational tape for this example or is it or is it a easier you need to somehow summarize this conversation into two phrases uh evaluating summer is super difficult i uh but outcomes most of us did it at some time.

Talking,3522,3590," think this would be fascinating for hackathons. It would be very difficult for the grand challenge because how do you evaluate this? Because we are not all secretly keeping track and having the ground truth. Maybe just one comment to this, because Jackquid also does this part-based evaluation, right, where they evaluate with some manual effort 10% of the submissions and then approximate how much there will be. Yeah, but if you do that, for example, with product annotations, I mean even 10% is a crazy amount of work. You're right. So there if you look at it the way I kind of participated also in some, the one that we won in New Yorker, Melange, that was 10 years ago with Monza. That one was brought by IBM and because they were based in New York, you know, like they wanted really, this is the definition of grand challenge. We wanna show New York using all this wealth of social media data from different perspectives. So competing teams had totally different solutions. Very interesting, somebody focused on the fashion of the city, you know, like city of fashion. Recommender systems, location recommender systems, and so on and so on. So, speaking about grand challenges, they have also tradition of these open-ended tasks. So, in that sense, what we kind of discussed now as a hackathon could also fit grand challenge. Right. But there the checking wasn't on individual items whether they're correct or not. No, no, no, absolutely not. It was really on the overall look and feel of the thing. Okay, but this is the more you have a jury that looks at this sort of stuff. Yes, yes, yes. The look and the feel of the thing is more than... They essentially grade the creativity and the quality of the output and... Yes, okay. Yeah, I mean, this is also something that would be interesting to do but I guess this would be two tracks within something I guess right the more qualitative versus the more quantitative in that case there was only the one right there was only one track there was only one track take because at that time for community community it was really important to see what can we do. Everybody talks about this social multimedia wealth and so on. What can we do? Let's start moving into building some systems that actually use it for something useful. Either tracking fashion trends, Hong Kong people did this, or location recommenders, what we did, and a few other groups as well, and so on and so on and so on. And just like saying here, there are many possibilities. It doesn't have to be really classic computer vision segmentation, or detection. You could also check our fashion, maybe find out who is wearing the same shirt as us. So you changed, you know? Who didn't do their laundry. No, I mean, I changed it to be the same as you. You got changed."

Talking,14,69, it might be very difficult to anticipate what you actually need interactively in order to solve a specific task you haven't seen yet.
"Based on the image, the most appropriate classification is **Eating**.

Here's why:

*   **Food is present:** There are plates with food, bread, and what appears to be fruit juice, all indicative of a meal.
*   **People are gathered around a table:** This is a common setting for eating.
*   **The person in the foreground is actively eating:** Their hand is near their mouth, and their posture suggests they are consuming food.
*   **Other people are also at the table:** While their specific actions aren't as clear, their presence in this context reinforces the idea of a shared meal.",69,71," So therefore, it might be much easier to say, okay, you have the data set. You also have all the tasks, the queries, whatever. And then you can start to build your thing. Whereas even if I give you a few examples, then you would need to anticipate the wealth, the possible universe of queries, which already for LSE is sometimes difficult when you come up with a new way of phrasing things. Oh yeah, but this is only answerable because of this type of information I never considered. And even though it was always there, nobody ever looked at it because it was never used. So therefore I would really emphasize the asynchronous part of this for new stuff. And if we want to do interactive things, then they should be reasonably close to things people are already familiar with. because we see with DBS and LLC how high the barrier of entry already is. And if we then say, okay, we're now gonna do something that is more complicated than this, or even at least more new, there's completely clean slate. And the people at this table will not have a lot of time to actually be participating with no because yeah because yeah no because everybody here is involved in actually building the back end of this so so there's not going to be participating teams yeah this this too but this is an independent problem. But even saying, look, everybody here is probably out of participating because of conflict of interest and because we might already know the ground truth because we have been there. That is a problem. So that already cuts out a whole swath of people who already have the experience with this sort of stuff. So it has to be easy. It has to have a... well the task can be difficult to do but it should not have a... it should not be difficult to attempt. So how would you design the S-U-Cronos part? It would be interactive, and we would still give rules of time limit? I would essentially have tasks where we do not specify very closely how people solve them, and just do the classic look. Here's a bunch of queries. Here's the format you're is supposed to present your results in here's the metrics we're going to use you have three months yeah go and you have a limit like I say you do an attractive task you have a limit of three minutes per or not even necessarily right because we you can track it also because you can you can say you have to specify how you did it and then we say if you if then we said if you have a thing that is completely automated, that does not require any human input, then it goes into one bucket. If you have a thing that was human-machine collaboration, it goes into another bucket. And then you're supposed to report, of course we cannot precisely validate this, but you're supposed to report the time, the number of rounds, or whatever is applicable for your approach. Again, this needs to be somewhat broad, because people might have very different approaches to do this. But ultimately, everybody just generates a rank-ordered list of results, or whatever fits the actual or the answer if we do question yes or a string or a or an integer value if it or something like this and then we will we will devaluate this in a maybe fully automated if we just have a ground truth we can compare it to maybe a judged and then we we do all this pooling stuff. We probably have to do a pooling because the data is going to be too big. I can think of some types of tasks. So for example if you, and this is something I alluded to yesterday, I'm already having, sneakily repositioning stuff all around"

Talking,461,1284," you have the receipts from shopping so you know how much stuff we don't think yes photocopies about picture pictures about yeah very long one but the stuff you today is not on video camera. No, no, no. But the stuff you bought today is not on the camera. If it's not on the camera, then you have to change the rest. It strikes me that that is a very nice hackathon task. The diet. Generate the recipe book. That's a simple hackathon task that we can actually say. This is what I meant before. That might also be a challenge though because that can be ground truth. We can evaluate it. We actually have to make our own recipe book again after this. What I would also like to do, what I think would be interesting more for maybe computer vision focused people, is if I brought the camera and I'm going to take some pictures later. And we can release some of those pictures, but not others. And then say, okay, what did the camera see? Reconstruct the image based on, you have a bunch of other cameras. You can reconstruct the scene because at least much of the environment doesn't change all that much. So you can probably generate a very accurate 3D reconstruction of the environment. And I'm just going to, you get a few training images to learn the properties of the camera. I think it's like, okay, what was the focal length? What are the sensor properties? And here we go. And then we have the images. I can't do a just pixel based, how accurate was the reconstruction. I like that. This is great. I also brought a thermal camera that we can take some. It's very low res and it only does pictures but we can run around with this and take some pictures and see if that gives something interesting."
Sitting,1284,1314,
**Eating**,1314,1463," Thank you. So I would not be surprised if there would be more commercial interests within the next few years to really try and put products into people's hands. I don't know to what degree these products are driven by needs or to what degree this is driven by what can we currently actually make work. Yeah, it's also like always like having a new feature for every release of another generation of devices, of course, because just saying okay there is now a few hundred thousand pixels more again at some point it's not the most catchy argument. We've run out of things you can perceive. So... Okay, so what's the next steps? Somebody writes down what we came up with and we have a discussion. Everyone is document... Everything is documented. Everything is... Yes. Another suggestion, maybe just a small one to spice it up. I start to think, you know.... There was this article, you know, like speaking of this pseudo psychology, you know, like about organizational theories and so on. Have you seen it? You take a sheet of paper, you literally salt it, you smash it right away and it reduces your stress. It was very well known in some journals of Dubious Science. Just salt a sheet of paper? Yeah, actually unbelievable, but okay. So, what I was thinking, you mentioned that... I just read an article, I couldn't believe it. Actually, some very well- names. Putting a pepper on me maybe reduces my stress. But do the salt anyway. And for yourself as well. So, what I was aiming at, somebody mentioned that we are going to be familiar with the data set and the process. People around us also a little bit more, you know, because you tell colleagues, friends, you know. For a hackathon, maybe it could be a good idea to assign to each team that applies, and we ask people to apply beforehand, a shepherd, somebody who's this or that way involved. And we kind of also organize it as a competition. Competition, you that Shapo is gonna be guiding the team you see where I'm going gonna helping them make the best out of what I want not really telling them what to do but kind of trying to squeeze I see some fronds probably not a good idea. I was thinking Werner takes team A from Tsinghua and Cakao takes Team... Oh, you're doing it like some American Idol or something. Yeah, that's the same thing. It's an interesting approach. I like the idea. I'm a bit worried about its implementation. Because many people on this table are going to be very busy these days especially during the time of that hackathon yeah we don't have any actually half people here won't have any spare time during that hackathon actually you won't either we should we should ideally have some some time during the hackathon because if we are busy running around then something went horribly horribly wrong in most cases it's the general chairs that will be busy handing out whiskeys and stuff so you guys should actually have an enjoyable weekend so you'll have time to stuff. Well I guess before the hackathon it could be the preparation phase, it could be light involvement. And yeah, I guess someone needs to be there anyway during the hackathon. So I think this shepherding idea could work. I'm not sure because you said putting it more like a competition. I don't think... I mean there might be very different ideas so you can't really compare them. More of a jury kind of thing. Which is okay, the TPC co-chairs will only be really busy in June, right? Chasing down a thousand missing reviews or something. Program stuff will happen in July, you'll have lots of time. So much time! You will not know what to do with all that time. You will have four weeks during the conference. Remember, there's one thing we have to keep in mind. Whatever we decide to do for the hackathon, poor Vincent will be under pressure to replicate it next year. It rolls on. Not entirely convinced that this is our immediate problem because we need to make it first we need to make it work the first time you make it attractive without change so I think some kind of reconstruction documentation make it very flexible yeah you can propose some health related topic like you know recipe sanity checking i don't know you know if you can evaluate if you if you have ways to evaluate you know public mental health you know can you apply them and and give people sanity ratings and see whether there's a decline that was okay that's the days of the workshop anything left to anything left to decline also interesting is all these um if you look at uh what people do with this uh tracking of elderly homes you know like yeah are people for example classic question are did they fall okay that's not happening here hopefully"
**Eating**,1463,1593," uh are people hydrated enough yeah yeah did they take enough of this did they take enough of that yeah and so on this is like what's going to be really useful for elderly people independent living yeah now we are hitting gold they won't wear this they may have those guys yeah exactly so the data sets are really useful for that yeah that's kind of a challenge totally totally maybe we get in touch with the company company you have a company that does that as well no i have we work with a company but they'd be really interested in sponsoring something like that right yeah i mean you can do those proxy tasks i mean this is this is the drug i'm supposed to take to keep me alive so exactly but it all ties in with the recipe generation did you put in the meals? The amount of consumption that each individual person has done. Can we pull that out of the two cameras? Did we get a variety of nutritional ingredients? It's such a nice data set. We have to at least get two years out of this data set before we make a new one though. Bigger and longer. With bigger SD cards. With bigger, more everything. I think this is something that is on the agenda for later in the week to see if we had infinite time and infinite money. Well this was done on a massive budget, that's why we're at the end of the world. If we had done this in Wicklow beside Dublin, short drive, access to more facilities close by, it would have been double the price. We had a rough envelope of 10,000. I mean these things are already right these things are nice they're not if we if we had designed this from scratch this would look different but then I would have had around 20,000 gets would have had to put together something we happen to have these no if we if we have to sign this from from scratch you're talking quite a bit more but we can always get this police like we know we talk about strapping these on here every time this"
Discussing,1593,1699," But at least if I move my head, at least you see what I'm looking at. If somebody builds a tracking camera with an eyeball eye movement detector built in... I mean, honestly, there are like fairly compact sensors for eye tracking. I mean, not like the one we have in the other room. There's things that could be done. If Luca has a lot of time to build it. If it's feasible, I'm not an electrical engineer. So this is probably if you actually need to do this. Electrical engineer. Glasses frames, two cameras, eye tracking and movement. It could all be done. It can be done. And a battery pack. To be fair, even in this version, as long as there are two people sort of facing each other, there should be a way to reconstruct that. This is definitely also some data augmentation thing I would want to do, right? If I look at you, can I reconstruct based on your feed where your point of attention was at any point in time, given that I see... That can be such a cool task. Actually estimation from another person's... I think your camera is also a little bit high. Can we reconstruct everything in VR? Can we just do one thing? Because Klaus now asked me, what did we finally conclude? So actually also, what do we know? For the challenge. For the challenge. So just like for the catch, and also for basically maybe it becomes a task, can we now summarize? This is what we think now Grand Challenge is roughly going to be."

"The most fitting category for this image is **Talking**.

Here's why:

*   **Group Activity:** The image clearly shows a group of people gathered around a table.
*   **Focus on Interaction:** While there is food and drink present, the body language and positioning of the individuals suggest a social gathering where conversation is a primary activity. Several people are looking at each other and appear engaged in discussion.
*   **Headsets:** The presence of headsets on most individuals might indicate they are participating in some form of interactive activity or even a game, but the most universally applicable descriptor given the visual cues is that they are conversing.",1757,2088," And the more traditional, you send us results, we're going to tell you how well you did. Non-interactive stuff. For the former it will probably have to be reasonably similar to the two interactive challenges we've already been doing. So have some instance retrieval and have some question answering with the human in the loop. And we would like to attract VPS teams and LSE teams. And we would do judging maybe with a few people from similar... Yes, so from a setup point of view, from an infrastructure point of view, also how the tasks are designed, how the tasks are presented, it would be the exact same thing as VPS and LSE. And then it could later go to the VPS and LSE, but for the first time... Yes, we might even push this into one of those possibly. Which makes the communication to the people reasonably easy. I mean what we might want to do anyway is just write a brief, if you have never heard of VPS and LSE, this is how it works, kind of document which we're missing anyway so onboarding for new teams is hard because you essentially have to chronologically read a decade of publications to see how the stuff actually works but that would be the interactive one and then there's a bunch of logistics we need to figure out but this is essentially just work so this So this is not difficult. And for non-interactive, we could do almost the same tasks, but asynchronously. Yes, plus more stuff. So some of the things that we've said that we can actually evaluate that are different type of tasks, as in reconstruct this view from this point. So I actually took the picture, but I'm not showing you the picture. Also, point of view like region of interest, slash salient objects or eye gaze from another person's point of view. That might be difficult to evaluate because we don't have the ground truth. Yeah. So this is more of a hackathon kind of thing. Yeah. Or because there can look at it and see if it is reasonable, but if two teams submit something similar, we don't have a precise metric to see how good is this. Because otherwise somebody would actually need to have the eye tracker. So this would be the... So definitely the question answering the instance retrieval stuff in both tracks. Yeah. And the non-interactive would have additional tracks for reconstruction-y things that you could not reasonably do interactively. That also would not necessarily need human input because it's more of an algorithmic. Like recipes or something that we could find. Yes, regenerate this recipe, regenerate this schedule for this person. Count the number of this person did this or on this day this kind of action was performed. This sort of thing.

The context suggests that the person might be in a kitchen or dining area. Since no specific action is depicted, it's difficult to assign a precise category from the given options. However, if we consider general activities that might occur in such a setting, ""Walking"" is a possibility if the person is moving. If they are stationary, then none of the options directly apply.

Given the limited information and the blurred nature of the image, a definitive classification is challenging.

"Based on the provided images, the most fitting classification is **Eating**.

Here's why:

*   **Food is prominently displayed:** There are bowls of food (soup, noodles, vegetables) on the table.
*   **People are gathered around the table:** The context suggests a mealtime setting.
*   **Utensils and plates are present:** This further supports the idea of dining.
*   **People are actively engaged with the food:** While some are blurred due to motion, the overall scene points to consumption of food.

They have this... You went to Busiat and Katl? This brewery? Special one? Was that on the first night? That was the very first one. Even before the thing started, you know? After VBS. Okay.
