Maybe with Werner I can play with. So we had a game called Rummy or something like this. You know this? I know. So you can put down sequences or matching things. So let's see if we're talking about the same game. I think it's a very long time ago I played that, probably. So you can... Okay, but you need to remember me. So you can put down sequences of... So the goal is to get rid of your cards, right? Yes. And every turn you have to draw one, you have to put down one, and in between you may put down either sequences of same suit or you can put down like you know three or four threes or three or four fours okay I think so it's just at the end whoever wins you basically get the points left on there no no sorry you get the point here, but they did just count normal Yeah, like you just count the so tennis a 10 Jackets 11 and so on And then you subtract whatever you have or you're on your hand, but if I put down three fours, right? Yes That's just 12 Four five six, but it must be the same color right yes okay or same suit yes okay and i i started with yes you start you have to draw draw first always draw and always put down okay okay and i think uh so i think twos the deuces are wild so you can use them with the wild cards so you can use them, they're wild cards, so you can use them for anything. The 2 is a wild card? Yes. So the way you used to play, you cannot actually put down on the first round, so neither of us can put down the first round. So it doesn't... But, so... Okay. Just to... Yeah. Yeah. So, but then you have to end up by putting a card down. Aha, right here. Right. Yes. And you can draw. So the options are you can draw one from here. You can take the top card.

The 2 is a wild card? Yes. So the way you used to play, you cannot actually put down on the first round, so neither of us can put down the first round. So it doesn't... But, so... Okay. Just to... Yeah. Yeah. So, but then you have to end up by putting a card down. Aha, right here. Right. Yes. And you can draw. So the options are you can draw one from here. You can take the top card.

So the goal is to get rid of your cards, right? Yes. And every turn you have to draw one, you have to put down one, and in between you may put down either sequences of same suit or you can put down like you know three or four threes or three or four fours okay I think so it's just at the end whoever wins you basically get the points left on there no no sorry you get the point here, but they did just count normal Yeah, like you just count the so tennis a 10 Jackets 11 and so on And then you subtract whatever you have or you're on your hand, but if I put down three fours, right? Yes That's just 12 Four five six, but it must be the same color right yes okay or same suit yes okay and i i started with yes you start you have to draw draw first always draw and always put down okay okay and i think uh so i think twos the deuces are wild so you can use them with the wild cards so you can use them, they're wild cards, so you can use them for anything. The 2 is a wild card? Yes. So the way you used to play, you cannot actually put down on the first round, so neither of us can put down the first round. So it doesn't... But, so... Okay. Just to... Yeah. Yeah. So, but then you have to end up by putting a card down. Aha, right here. Right. Yes. And you can draw. So the options are you can draw one from here. You can take the top card.

Playing Games,1709,1876," Oh. Yes. And then this is for Asis and I say Rami. Okay, Steve, you're done. I see, okay. Yeah, all right. All right, good. And basically the rule was that when counting, we used to count the twos as two here, but if they're on your hand, they're 20. The twos, really? Yes, because they're wild cards. So if you leave them, if you haven't used them... Then a queen and a king and they're all 10. No, they're 10, 11, 13, I think. Aha, okay. Maybe, maybe they're all 10s. But this one is basically, on the table it's two, on your hand it's twenty. Anyway, so I think these are the rules that I can remember. We have twins in our village that played this through school and they had a book and they were writing down scores and and they did this like you know for four months at some point always keeping"
Playing Games,1876,1946," Now, for me, right? Yes, you can. Perfect. Yes. Yeah. Now for me as a strategy. I have also a wild card here. Okay. There you go. Yes. Then you can close. Yes. All right. Well, I can say if you couldn't finish, then I would not use the wild card. Yes. Because I would keep it as an option for extending because you might get, you know, you might get nine, ten, you might get a jack here. Yes. And then two wild cards would actually work. Right. Right. But in this case it doesn't matter, right? Yes. Nice. Okay. Good. It's a fun game. It's a good game. You can, and it extends nicely4 people. It's not just a two person game. Beyond that you start to run out of cards. And the most fun is when you have a big stack and you get everything. then you can even if you lose the game you can sometimes get lots and lots and lots of points. If you're counting the points it can actually pay off. So I have to draw one? Yeah always draw. And put down one. I'm not sure which one, but yeah. Yeah, because you don't know anything about my hand yet, so... Turn on the camera. Yeah. Look at his camera. Ah, look at my camera. It doesn't have a picture, right? In the front, I mean. Yeah, but it's in reflection. Oh Right, and of course we should we should turn down you see it"

Playing Games,2066,2097," No, you didn't. This is already 3 minutes to 1. Mm-hmm. Right. Oh. Yes. Okay. Rummy. It's a card game. You can check the video. No, it's a... It's... Basically, the goal is to get rid of the cards. You can put down rows of suits, so four, five, six in the same color, or you can put down five, five, five in different colors, always at minimum three. Twos are wild, and then you always have to draw. you also have to put down a card and then whoever gets rid of the cards first wins. That's the idea. That's a rough idea. So now it's a, we had very short games so far and now it's a longer one and you can draw one here one from the top or you can take the whole stack you can run from that like that too yes and now i closed Rami that was the card i needed Very Good!

Eating,2971,3018," You build your system, you give me the queries,"
Sitting,3018,3102," It has a title, a description, and then a narrative that says, oh, eating breakfast is relevant only if it includes Werner. There's a description like that that makes it very, very clear. And people do that in their own time. By a certain date, they submit the runs. We pool all people's runs together and generate the ground truth. We don't evaluate everything. It's not a complete ground truth. It's a pooled ground truth. So it's never going to be perfect, but it's going to be sufficient to differentiate existence. That we can do in Olive Otter. That's simple, we do that all the time. The challenge here is that it's probably a bit more difficult data to work with, but that's great. Then we can do some really interesting interactive things in the workshop. Where the queries are different, like some kind of really this this interaction queries we have the time I was talking to Ali about the NTCR queries you hadn't yet released what was the outcome of that what was the outcome of that conversation those countries much nicer things to do and that's really interesting I think for an interactive challenge not, but answer it. But this is a different... This is also somewhat difficult to evaluate, because, I mean, we need to phrase this very precisely, because what was the outcome of this conversation is not something that has a precise answer. But that's what we do with the judges, right? The judges make decisions in the systems. Yeah, but currently what we have is, like that is very short answer with some degrees of freedom, but if you like ask for outcome of a conversation, you could write a paragraph on that. Yeah, okay, we limit the... Like we do this with the Q&A things already. What airline? Oh Turkish airlines or whatever turkish fine fine about okay"
Talking,3102,3210," we only don't phrase it like that so basically how the queries in a known item and i think not not in ad hoc but in non-item i think are formulated that's a multi-turn retrieval if we don't go for a full conversation but conversational search for example that's pretty much how you formulate and evaluate query sorted. You provide a bit of information, then people stop looking, but it's funny, you know, on the microphone people say, okay, nobody finding. And then typically Werner or you kind of says, aha, additional piece of information, you know, like that girl running up the hill to the father towards the flag. Then you provide the next bit of information. What is the target? Is it a pure retrieval task, as in find the end of this conversational chain, for this example? That's easier. Or is it a... Easier to evaluate. You need to somehow summarize this conversation into two phrases. Evaluating somewhere is super difficult. Yes. But outcomes... Maybe... Most of us did it that time. Maybe my example was bad. It doesn't necessarily have to be the outcome of a conversation. It can be the outcome of cooking breakfast on the third day. How many croissants were left? Whatever is that kind of query, right? You make the query something that actually you can identify and you can be pretty sure it's correct or reasonably correct. Yes, but this is an easy fact finding and then you could either have a pure value as a result, as in I did something, my answer is 3, I'm not going to tell you how I got it, or you have to actually identify the crossholes and say, well, show me all the instances."

So basically that when you provide the answer, you have the things you looked at and say, well, this is the information I used to come up with the answer. I would like to bring an additional aspect to this discussion because the the grand challenge traditionally was always funded by companies and in a way that they also get some output right and even though I fully agree with all of you that we need interactive challenges I think for the grand challenge at ACM Multimedia we could also maybe do some sub tasks like labeling for example many people in multimedia are working on food recognition so it could be a collaborative annotation task also and then later on from that collaborative annotation we could extract metadata and later on maybe use it for the interactive challenges as a ground truth even though it might not be completely correct of course. But as a challenge, if you put it as a challenge, how do you evaluate it? I mean the challenge has kind of this competition character. Is that the hackathon stuff? Yeah, exactly. So it's more hackathon, yeah. Looking at what came out of that meeting in HTML3 on the first morning, it was a health-based hackathon is what they wanted to do. And we're naturally going to feed into that if we use this data set. There's some interesting things we can do about this. For example, all of these things have barcodes on them. Right, right, right. So you can cross-reference this with the international product database and know exactly what this was. And then you can track how much of this, because it happens to be fresh milk by Apple Green, how much of this was consumed over what amount of time. And, mean, essentially, it will be difficult to track who actually consumed what."

"This segment falls under the category of **Eating**. The image depicts a group of people gathered around a dining table laden with food and drinks, suggesting a meal is in progress.",3412,3615," This sort of stuff. I think this would be fascinating for for a hackathon it would be very difficult for the for the grand challenge because how do you evaluate this because we we are not all secretly keeping track and maybe just one comment to this track track fit also does this part-based evaluation, right? Where they evaluate with some manual effort 10% of the submissions, and then approximate how much there will be. Yeah, if you do that, for example, with product annotations, I mean, even 10% is a crazy amount of work. A lot, yeah, you're right. So there are some grand challenges if you look at it the way I kind of participated also in some and the one that we won in New York, that was 10 years ago with Monza. That one was brought by IBM and because they were based in New York, you know, like they wanted really, this is the definition of grand. We want to show in New York using all this wealth of social media data from different perspectives. So competing teams had totally different solutions. Very interesting. Somebody focused on the fashion of the city, you know, like city of fashion, recommender systems, location recommender systems and so on and so on. So, when I'm speaking about grand challenges, they have also tradition of these open-ended tasks. So, in that sense, what we kind of discussed now as a hackathon could also fit grand challenge. Right. But there the checking wasn't on individual items whether they're correct or not. It was on the overall look and feel of the thing yeah but so this is but this is the more you have a jury that looks at this so yeah absolutely yes yes yes it's more the look and the feel of the thing it's more than actually great yes the creativity and the quality of the output presentation yeah yeah yeah i mean this is this is also something that would be interesting to do, but I guess this would be two tracks within something like this, right? The more qualitative versus the more quantitative. Well, in that case there was only the one, right? There was only one track of that grand challenge. There was only one track. Because at that time for the community really important to see a vote can we do everybody talks about this social multimedia wealth and so on what can we do you know like and let's start moving into building some systems that actually use it for something useful you know either tracking fashion trends Hong Kong people did this or location recommend us what we did in a few other groups as well and so on and so on and so on I'm just like saying here there"

So anyhow the head of department came and he was really like hey look there are these panoramas but we have no idea what they can be used for and we are totally willing to invest this much and this much you know like if we see kind of evidence that you can reliably detect automatically all the advertisements in public space so there comes another person that says oh you if you can show us this and this so there were like five six people that came and for two days people were busy really and actually they were even kind of sometimes describing it very vaguely but they were like really a there must be something that we are not seeing there because otherwise we would be probably using it if you find something useful in it when it comes to advertisement and so on please also let us know so but I'm going with this one we have this data now so for a hackathon I think it would be handy to give some guidelines and give some ideas a look invite some people from our community that have been working on a food like that saying and so on and so on they kind of say a look this is what community has been doing some people that were doing this could be in this direction doesn't have"
Sitting,708,805," it's probably not the original ingredients so what did we get? Close enough. Close enough, that's really great. What did you replace with what? So I think that kind of stuff. And then kind of, that's hackathon and for I think for grand challenge at least I think we need to keep some interaction because if you look what most of the people do, like in NeurIPSY, Cycliers, computer vision conferences and so on, it's mostly fully automatic stuff. And this is like sports event. It's fun. I think that's some kind of joy that we are bringing to the table. Yes, yes. Of a conference, any conference. Absolutely. But then again, interactive has a high barrier of entry, so it should not be exclusive. Yeah, I think what's coming out from the conversation is there's an asynchronous task and there's a synchronous task. Yeah. The asynchronous task is going to be lower barrier to entry. Any student in any university that can get his hands on 20 terabytes or her hands on 20 terabytes of disk space can process the dataset, can process 24 queries or whatever we decide to do, send in results, pool relevant judgments, submission back, whatever, write answers back, results back. And those that want to do the interactive element will come to the actual conference definitely, right? And they will take part in an interactive grant challenge, which is part of the conference. That's why they asked us to do it, right and they will take part in an interactive grand challenge which is part of the conference that's why they asked us to do it right they wanted the VBS and the LSE in the conference. And they need more interaction like we forgot that one like that was the thing multi modality agents interaction that's like basically three cornerstones. So we take it back to the simplest thing there's a ad hoc and there's a q a"

The scene depicts a group of people seated around a table laden with food and drinks, suggesting they are in the process of consuming a meal.",805,931," sect session and then we lead to an uh synchronous challenge which is ad hoc and q and a maybe something else thrown in there people know well in advance and that's the first year and actually we use the same data set do it again with a grander set of challenges for people that does look at their recipe creation or whatever it is we decide we want to do but we get it kicked off where we can show their success by having what a success 10 participants yeah I mean I ideally this would then also grow over time yes there's a lot of data that there's a lot of data augmentation that can be done yes so ideally what I would What I would like to see at some point, which should be very doable for a large fraction of time, so most of us are going to be visible by at least one camera most of the time. We have a trajectory that can be reconstructed just based on the sensor streams that should be on this. So you should not only be able to have the position of every person in time, you could also do the full pose reconstruction, have all the skeleton control points. So you essentially can back project the people into the space, how they were posing, and then do this for all the action-y things, interact-y things, even if people want to do robot-y things, right? You at least have a armature, how did people interact and stuff. But this is not necessarily very difficult from a technology, or at least from a science point of view. So methods to do this exist, it is just going to be work. But is that the CDB order on challenge then? Yeah, so we're not going to release this in February with a high fidelity annotated skeleton post thing, because even if somebody wanted to do this, it would just take some time time wouldn't it be something someone could do for the hackathon yes yes something like this i would i would totally put something like this on the on the list the hackathon focus was health care wellness yes but even now we can do two right post reconstruction is a number of healthcare applications motion motion for somebody yeah emotional nearly person around"

Sponsored by ACM Multimedia. One thing I was thinking also before this tutorial on XR search, one insight was basically there's work on mixed reality search engines like they do at Basel, but there is no way of evaluating them. So this could also be one thing like, I mean, I was thinking you have a lot of things happening in the kitchen, so you could be in a real kitchen where you have items that you could use as query objects. So this could also be an exploration of like, how would you set up a comparative interactive environment in which you test XR or MR search right which is really something that's not not there yet which is interesting enough because there's commercial interest in actually building some things yeah and there's I mean this it's very wild west these days and there's people trying all these sort of things it's very niche at this point in time but ubiquitous computing has been a buzzword for a while and is cooking up every once in a while so I would not be surprised if there would be more commercial interests within the next few years to really try and put products into people's hands. I don't know to what degree these products are driven by needs or to what degree this is driven by what can we currently actually make work. Yeah, of course, it's also like always having a new feature for every release of another generation of devices, of course. Because just saying, okay, there is now a few hundred thousand pixels more again, at some point it's not the most catchy argument. We've run out of things you can perceive. Yeah. Yeah. So OK, so what's the next steps? Somebody writes down what we came up with, and we have a decision. Money's document. Everything is document. Everything is, yes. Another suggestion, maybe, just a small one to spice it up. We started thinking of spice it up actually. There was this article, you know, like speaking of this pseudo-psychology, you know, like about organizational theories and so on. Have you seen Well, you told me about this, yes. You take a sheet of paper, you literally salt it, you smash it right away and it reduces your stress. It was very well known in some journals of dubious science. Yeah, actually unbelievable, but okay. So what I was thinking, you mentioned that... I just read an article, I couldn't believe it. Actually some very well very well-known names they've made. So putting a pepper on me maybe reduces my stress. But do the salt. Anyway, and for yourself as well. So what I was aiming at, somebody mentioned that we are going to be familiar with the data set and our process. People around us also a little bit more, you know, right? Because you tell colleagues, friends, you know. For a hackathon, maybe it could be a good idea to assign to each team that applies, and we ask people to apply beforehand, a shepherd, somebody who is this or that way involved. And we kind of also organize it as a competition. Competition, you know, meaning that Shepard is going to be guiding that team. You see where I'm going? Helping them make the best out of what they want. Not really telling them what to do. But kind of trying to squeeze. I see some fronds. Probably not a good idea. I was thinking, let's say Werner takes team A from Tsinghua and Kajal takes team from... Oh, you're doing it like American Idol or something like that. Something like that, yeah. Why not? It's an interesting approach. I like the idea. I'm a bit worried about its implementation. Because many people on this table are going to be very busy these days especially during the time of that hackathon. Yeah we won't have any actually half the people here won't have any spare time during that hackathon. Actually you won't either. Yeah yeah yeah. To be fair... Because it's going to be in a weekend. We should have some time during the hackathon because if we are busy running around, then something went horribly wrong. Well, in most cases, it's the general chairs that will be busy handing out whiskeys and stuff. So you guys should actually have an enjoyable week in reality. Well, I guess to do stuff. Well, I guess before the hackathon it could be in the preparation phase. It could be light involvement. And yeah, I guess someone needs to be there anyway during the hackathon. So I think this shepherding idea could work. I'm not sure because you said putting it more in competition. I don't think... I mean, there might be very different ideas. So you can't really compare them. So it's more of a jury kind of thing. Jury, yeah. Which is okay. The TPC co-church will only be really busy in June, right? Chasing down a thousand missing reviews at the moment. Program and all the things. The program stuff will happen in July, right? Once you know all the… You'll have lots of time. Lots of time. So much time. You will not know what to do with it. You will have four weeks to do the conference. Remember, there's one thing we have to keep in mind. Whatever we decide to do for the hackathon, poor Vincent will be under pressure to replicate it next year. It rolls on. Yeah, not your worry. I'm not entirely convinced that this is our immediate problem because we need to make it first we need to make it work the first time you make it attractive but I think you know some kind of reconstruction data augmentation make it very flexible you can propose some health related topics like you know recipe you know checking, I don't know, if you can evaluate. If you have ways to evaluate public mental health, can you apply them and give people sanity ratings and see whether there's a decline across the days of the workshop? Whatever you want.

Because you tell colleagues, friends, you know. For a hackathon, maybe it could be a good idea to assign to each team that applies, and we ask people to apply beforehand, a shepherd, somebody who is this or that way involved. And we kind of also organize it as a competition. Competition, you know, meaning that Shepard is going to be guiding that team. You see where I'm going? Helping them make the best out of what they want. Not really telling them what to do. But kind of trying to squeeze. I see some fronds. Probably not a good idea. I was thinking, let's say Werner takes team A from Tsinghua and Kajal takes team from... Oh, you're doing it like American Idol or something like that. Something like that, yeah. Why not? It's an interesting approach. I like the idea. I'm a bit worried about its implementation. Because many people on this table are going to be very busy these days especially during the time of that hackathon. Yeah we won't have any actually half the people here won't have any spare time during that hackathon. Actually you won't either. Yeah yeah yeah. To be fair... Because it's going to be in a weekend. We should have some time during the hackathon because if we are busy running around, then something went horribly wrong. Well, in most cases, it's the general chairs that will be busy handing out whiskeys and stuff. So you guys should actually have an enjoyable week in reality. Well, I guess to do stuff. Well, I guess before the hackathon it could be in the preparation phase. It could be light involvement. And yeah, I guess someone needs to be there anyway during the hackathon. So I think this shepherding idea could work. I'm not sure because you said putting it more in competition. I don't think... I mean, there might be very different ideas. So you can't really compare them. So it's more of a jury kind of thing. Jury, yeah. Which is okay. The TPC co-church will only be really busy in June, right? Chasing down a thousand missing reviews at the moment. Program and all the things. The program stuff will happen in July, right? Once you know all the… You'll have lots of time. Lots of time. So much time. You will not know what to do with it. You will have four weeks to do the conference. Remember, there's one thing we have to keep in mind. Whatever we decide to do for the hackathon, poor Vincent will be under pressure to replicate it next year. It rolls on. Yeah, not your worry. I'm not entirely convinced that this is our immediate problem because we need to make it first we need to make it work the first time you make it attractive but I think you know some kind of reconstruction data augmentation make it very flexible you can propose some health related topics like you know recipe you know checking, I don't know, if you can evaluate. If you have ways to evaluate public mental health, can you apply them and give people sanity ratings and see whether there's a decline across the days of the workshop? Whatever you want.

So this could also be one thing like, I mean, I was thinking you have a lot of things happening in the kitchen, so you could be in a real kitchen where you have items that you could use as query objects. So this could also be an exploration of like, how would you set up a comparative interactive environment in which you test XR or MR search right which is really something that's not not there yet which is interesting enough because there's commercial interest in actually building some things yeah and there's I mean this it's very wild west these days and there's people trying all these sort of things it's very niche at this point in time but ubiquitous computing has been a buzzword for a while and is cooking up every once in a while so I would not be surprised if there would be more commercial interests within the next few years to really try and put products into people's hands. I don't know to what degree these products are driven by needs or to what degree this is driven by what can we currently actually make work.

If you have ways to evaluate public mental health, can you apply them and give people sanity ratings and see whether there's a decline across the days of the workshop? Whatever you want.

Sponsored by ACM Multimedia. One thing I was thinking also before this tutorial on XR search, one insight was basically there's work on mixed reality search engines like they do at Basel, but there is no way of evaluating them. So this could also be one thing like, I mean, I was thinking you have a lot of things happening in the kitchen, so you could be in a real kitchen where you have items that you could use as query objects. So this could also be an exploration of like, how would you set up a comparative interactive environment in which you test XR or MR search right which is really something that's not not there yet which is interesting enough because there's commercial interest in actually building some things yeah and there's I mean this it's very wild west these days and there's people trying all these sort of things it's very niche at this point in time but ubiquitous computing has been a buzzword for a while and is cooking up every once in a while so I would not be surprised if there would be more commercial interests within the next few years to really try and put products into people's hands. I don't know to what degree these products are driven by needs or to what degree this is driven by what can we currently actually make work. Yeah, of course, it's also like always having a new feature for every release of another generation of devices, of course. Because just saying, okay, there is now a few hundred thousand pixels more again, at some point it's not the most catchy argument. We've run out of things you can perceive. Yeah. Yeah. So OK, so what's the next steps? Somebody writes down what we came up with, and we have a decision. Money's document. Everything is document. Everything is, yes. Another suggestion, maybe, just a small one to spice it up. We started thinking of spice it up actually. There was this article, you know, like speaking of this pseudo-psychology, you know, like about organizational theories and so on. Have you seen Well, you told me about this, yes. You take a sheet of paper, you literally salt it, you smash it right away and it reduces your stress. It was very well known in some journals of dubious science. Yeah, actually unbelievable, but okay. So what I was thinking, you mentioned that... I just read an article, I couldn't believe it. Actually some very well very well-known names they've made. So putting a pepper on me maybe reduces my stress. But do the salt. Anyway, and for yourself as well. So what I was aiming at, somebody mentioned that we are going to be familiar with the data set and our process. People around us also a little bit more, you know, right? Because you tell colleagues, friends, you know. For a hackathon, maybe it could be a good idea to assign to each team that applies, and we ask people to apply beforehand, a shepherd, somebody who is this or that way involved. And we kind of also organize it as a competition. Competition, you know, meaning that Shepard is going to be guiding that team. You see where I'm going? Helping them make the best out of what they want. Not really telling them what to do. But kind of trying to squeeze. I see some fronds. Probably not a good idea. I was thinking, let's say Werner takes team A from Tsinghua and Kajal takes team from... Oh, you're doing it like American Idol or something like that. Something like that, yeah. Why not? It's an interesting approach. I like the idea. I'm a bit worried about its implementation. Because many people on this table are going to be very busy these days especially during the time of that hackathon. Yeah we won't have any actually half the people here won't have any spare time during that hackathon. Actually you won't either. Yeah yeah yeah. To be fair... Because it's going to be in a weekend. We should have some time during the hackathon because if we are busy running around, then something went horribly wrong. Well, in most cases, it's the general chairs that will be busy handing out whiskeys and stuff. So you guys should actually have an enjoyable week in reality. Well, I guess to do stuff. Well, I guess before the hackathon it could be in the preparation phase. It could be light involvement. And yeah, I guess someone needs to be there anyway during the hackathon.

So this could also be an exploration of like, how would you set up a comparative interactive environment in which you test XR or MR search right which is really something that's not not there yet which is interesting enough because there's commercial interest in actually building some things yeah and there's I mean this it's very wild west these days and there's people trying all these sort of things it's very niche at this point in time but ubiquitous computing has been a buzzword for a while and is cooking up every once in a while so I would not be surprised if there would be more commercial interests within the next few years to really try and put products into people's hands. I don't know to what degree these products are driven by needs or to what degree this is driven by what can we currently actually make work. Yeah, of course, it's also like always having a new feature for every release of another generation of devices, of course. Because just saying, okay, there is now a few hundred thousand pixels more again, at some point it's not the most catchy argument. We've run out of things you can perceive. Yeah. Yeah. So OK, so what's the next steps? Somebody writes down what we came up with, and we have a decision. Money's document. Everything is document. Everything is, yes. Another suggestion, maybe, just a small one to spice it up. We started thinking of spice it up actually. There was this article, you know, like speaking of this pseudo-psychology, you know, like about organizational theories and so on. Have you seen Well, you told me about this, yes. You take a sheet of paper, you literally salt it, you smash it right away and it reduces your stress. It was very well known in some journals of dubious science. Yeah, actually unbelievable, but okay. So what I was thinking, you mentioned that... I just read an article, I couldn't believe it. Actually some very well very well-known names they've made. So putting a pepper on me maybe reduces my stress. But do the salt. Anyway, and for yourself as well. So what I was aiming at, somebody mentioned that we are going to be familiar with the data set and our process. People around us also a little bit more, you know, right? Because you tell colleagues, friends, you know. For a hackathon, maybe it could be a good idea to assign to each team that applies, and we ask people to apply beforehand, a shepherd, somebody who is this or that way involved. And we kind of also organize it as a competition. Competition, you know, meaning that Shepard is going to be guiding that team. You see where I'm going? Helping them make the best out of what they want. Not really telling them what to do. But kind of trying to squeeze. I see some fronds. Probably not a good idea. I was thinking, let's say Werner takes team A from Tsinghua and Kajal takes team from... Oh, you're doing it like American Idol or something like that. Something like that, yeah. Why not? It's an interesting approach. I like the idea. I'm a bit worried about its implementation. Because many people on this table are going to be very busy these days especially during the time of that hackathon. Yeah we won't have any actually half the people here won't have any spare time during that hackathon. Actually you won't either. Yeah yeah yeah. To be fair... Because it's going to be in a weekend. We should have some time during the hackathon because if we are busy running around, then something went horribly wrong. Well, in most cases, it's the general chairs that will be busy handing out whiskeys and stuff. So you guys should actually have an enjoyable week in reality. Well, I guess to do stuff. Well, I guess before the hackathon it could be in the preparation phase. It could be light involvement. And yeah, I guess someone needs to be there anyway during the hackathon. So I think this shepherding idea could work. I'm not sure because you said putting it more in competition. I don't think... I mean, there might be very different ideas. So you can't really compare them. So it's more of a jury kind of thing. Jury, yeah. Which is okay. The TPC co-church will only be really busy in June, right? Chasing down a thousand missing reviews at the moment. Program and all the things. The program stuff will happen in July, right? Once you know all the… You'll have lots of time. Lots of time. So much time. You will not know what to do with it. You will have four weeks to do the conference. Remember, there's one thing we have to keep in mind. Whatever we decide to do for the hackathon, poor Vincent will be under pressure to replicate it next year. It rolls on. Yeah, not your worry. I'm not entirely convinced that this is our immediate problem because we need to make it first we need to make it work the first time you make it attractive but I think you know some kind of reconstruction data augmentation make it very flexible you can propose some health related topics like you know recipe you know checking, I don't know, if you can evaluate. If you have ways to evaluate public mental health, can you apply them and give people sanity ratings and see whether there's a decline across the days of the workshop? Whatever you want.

So what I was aiming at, somebody mentioned that we are going to be familiar with the data set and our process. People around us also a little bit more, you know, right? Because you tell colleagues, friends, you know. For a hackathon, maybe it could be a good idea to assign to each team that applies, and we ask people to apply beforehand, a shepherd, somebody who is this or that way involved. And we kind of also organize it as a competition. Competition, you know, meaning that Shepard is going to be guiding that team. You see where I'm going? Helping them make the best out of what they want. Not really telling them what to do. But kind of trying to squeeze. I see some fronds. Probably not a good idea. I was thinking, let's say Werner takes team A from Tsinghua and Kajal takes team from... Oh, you're doing it like American Idol or something like that. Something like that, yeah. Why not? It's an interesting approach. I like the idea. I'm a bit worried about its implementation. Because many people on this table are going to be very busy these days especially during the time of that hackathon. Yeah we won't have any actually half the people here won't have any spare time during that hackathon. Actually you won't either. Yeah yeah yeah. To be fair... Because it's going to be in a weekend. We should have some time during the hackathon because if we are busy running around, then something went horribly wrong. Well, in most cases, it's the general chairs that will be busy handing out whiskeys and stuff. So you guys should actually have an enjoyable week in reality. Well, I guess to do stuff. Well, I guess before the hackathon it could be in the preparation phase. It could be light involvement. And yeah, I guess someone needs to be there anyway during the hackathon. So I think this shepherding idea could work. I'm not sure because you said putting it more in competition. I don't think... I mean, there might be very different ideas. So you can't really compare them. So it's more of a jury kind of thing. Jury, yeah. Which is okay. The TPC co-church will only be really busy in June, right? Chasing down a thousand missing reviews at the moment. Program and all the things. The program stuff will happen in July, right? Once you know all the… You'll have lots of time. Lots of time. So much time. You will not know what to do with it. You will have four weeks to do the conference. Remember, there's one thing we have to keep in mind. Whatever we decide to do for the hackathon, poor Vincent will be under pressure to replicate it next year. It rolls on. Yeah, not your worry. I'm not entirely convinced that this is our immediate problem because we need to make it first we need to make it work the first time you make it attractive but I think you know some kind of reconstruction data augmentation make it very flexible you can propose some health related topics like you know recipe you know checking, I don't know, if you can evaluate. If you have ways to evaluate public mental health, can you apply them and give people sanity ratings and see whether there's a decline across the days of the workshop? Whatever you want. Anything left to decline. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's the taste of the workshop. No, whatever you want, right? Anything left to decline."
Talking,1376,1405," the home yeah yeah social interaction healthcare we need to knock people over sanity checking you want to go there Ivalio to average sanity over time. For the hackathon, I would even keep it more open. Yes. This is the broad topic. These are some possible things we have come up with that we think would be interesting. You are supposed to, if you want to participate, sign up, propose a team, propose a task, and probably we will just accept everything that is sensible and as long as we have the capacity and then our hackathon chairs are going to figure out all the rest and possibly maybe we can get somebody to sponsor a best hackathon or something. Sponsored by ACM Multimedia. One thing I was thinking also before this tutorial on XR search, one insight was basically there's work on mixed reality search engines like they do at Basel, but there is no way of evaluating them. So this could also be one thing like, I mean, I was thinking you have a lot of things happening in the kitchen, so you could be in a real kitchen where you have items that you could use as query objects. So this could also be an exploration of like, how would you set up a comparative interactive environment in which you test XR or MR search right which is really something that's not not there yet which is interesting enough because there's commercial interest in actually building some things yeah and there's I mean this it's very wild west these days and there's people trying all these sort of things it's very niche at this point in time but ubiquitous computing has been a buzzword for a while and is cooking up every once in a while so I would not be surprised if there would be more commercial interests within the next few years to really try and put products into people's hands. I don't know to what degree these products are driven by needs or to what degree this is driven by what can we currently actually make work. Yeah, of course, it's also like always having a new feature for every release of another generation of devices, of course. Because just saying, okay, there is now a few hundred thousand pixels more again, at some point it's not the most catchy argument. We've run out of things you can perceive. Yeah. Yeah. So OK, so what's the next steps? Somebody writes down what we came up with, and we have a decision. Money's document. Everything is document. Everything is, yes. Another suggestion, maybe, just a small one to spice it up. We started thinking of spice it up actually. There was this article, you know, like speaking of this pseudo-psychology, you know, like about organizational theories and so on. Have you seen Well, you told me about this, yes. You take a sheet of paper, you literally salt it, you smash it right away and it reduces your stress. It was very well known in some journals of dubious science. Yeah, actually unbelievable, but okay. So what I was thinking, you mentioned that... I just read an article, I couldn't believe it. Actually some very well very well-known names they've made.

But 4 bears in a row can beat also a pair of 2. Okay. Can this beat that? Only one. So what can I beat? Only four players in a row. Ah, I see. It's a bit different. Yes.

That's before 4th of December. Used by 4th of December. Yeah, but we didn't have pot today. We ate at lunch. I think there's still too much chicken. We got two chicken meals. There's chicken hot pot and there's chicken curry. Chicken curry, yeah. Thursday. Yeah, I think that's okay. We'll check and see. Okay. You don't need chicken is the question. I don't need chicken i mean i can probably integrate chicken if you want but uh no no no no you want to prepare dollar you have two kilograms of lamb it is a aloo gobi and dal so it's basically vegetarian food yes well depends on the there's probably going to be some butter in there but outside outside that. Lamb curry. Lamb curry... yeah, but it's different than lamb... that's minced lamb. Lamb burger? Right. So we can do a demo, so you can open all of their cards. Of course you don't in the real match. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Open everything and then we can play. Right. Okay, so wow, I have three twos. So that means something strong. Very strong, almost a win. Okay. Unless you are really unlucky otherwise. Or stupid. No. You are not stupid. Or you are really unlucky. Or I don't know the game. Yes. That's interesting. So then there is a question of strategy, right? Not even strategy but how evil you are because. Because you can skip it, even if you can move, but you can skip it. Okay. It's on your choice. You're not forced to go. Right. And sometimes because of the points, if I hate you, and the next one I will try my best. Even though I know I will lose the game, but if I hate you, I will like you. You will try to give me points? Yes. Okay. Especially the ambush. Right. It's a very secret. Yes. So we show our card too? No, just try to teach me the game. Yeah. I still don't understand the game. Actually, me too. You can leave. We try to discard all the cards. Yes.

He got one point, I got zero. So four parts, right? So simple game, yes. If you play simple, you don't count the penalty, then no problem. Not really, but then whoever gets to be the king will have to exchange the card with the slave. If the slave has to give two base cards, something like that. But if anyone wins, the king immediately goes straight to be a slave. Alright.

Playing Games,966,978," If you go for the point, you lose a lot, because first you go the last, and then you still have this, you've got minus two. So when it's your turn, you should put out the two. Yeah, try to get rid of the two as soon as possible. Right. So you can't be in this sequence? No, you can't. But you can go, even go for this, or you can go for it here very fast. If you see that you don't have a chance to win... So it's a Vietnamese game? I didn't know that. No, no, yeah, we are learning. It's not simple. Let's say. Vietnamese are so complicated. Sorry. That's okay. I'm going to attempt an airplane. Are you playing also? Then I'll explain again. Yeah, if you don't mind. We can do one game and explain. Yes. And basically try to make the logic. Yeah, okay. Okay. So... Actually, no, it's easier to... So the idea me let me try to summarize ideas to get rid of your cards okay that sounds like many other cards yeah yeah and and basically like whoever's turn is to do can decide on kind of the format of this you can put down one card you can put on a sequence of cards like okay three four five six in different suits you can put on pairs or triples or something format of this. You can put down one card, you can put down a sequence of cards, like three, four, five, six, in different suits. You can put down pairs or triples or something like this. And then everybody else has to follow that pattern, but always put higher. But is this like jolly? Maybe, because I don't know that game either. But always put higher. But the order of suits is a little bit different. So you haveade is the lowest yeah clubs then diamonds and hearts okay so if somebody puts down you know three three of spades that then you could put down three of clubs on top okay so you have to follow that secret yes you can't just three of this no but it's for example if he puts he puts this down But you have to you have to you have to raise Okay, so you can mix me you can mix so if it's just one card then you can basically You put one card as long as it's higher. Okay, and it's higher It is basically a higher number or higher suit or not and Not, not or or so so for example if he puts down this which is higher than the spade then you could not put that down you could put that down but i could put any but if he puts this down yeah if he puts that down you have a choice order is spades clubs diamond heart okay so black ones and, heart. Okay. So black ones, black ones. And then the two is basically a special card. It's not part of the sequence. It's the highest card. Okay. And so it kind of ends the game any two, yes. Any two. But I guess it's the same sequence. Like if you put down the spade two and I have the the club two then i can top your two exactly yes okay okay but the way to top that a two is with um three pairs so if you have three pairs you can actually top a two several x okay exception yes if you have four in the row yeah you bit uh pair two two. Sorry, you beat a two. Okay."

Yeah, okay. Okay. So... Actually, no, it's easier to... So the idea me let me try to summarize ideas to get rid of your cards okay that sounds like many other cards yeah yeah and and basically like whoever's turn is to do can decide on kind of the format of this you can put down one card you can put on a sequence of cards like okay three four five six in different suits you can put on pairs or triples or something format of this. You can put down one card, you can put down a sequence of cards, like three, four, five, six, in different suits. You can put down pairs or triples or something like this. And then everybody else has to follow that pattern, but always put higher. But is this like jolly? Maybe, because I don't know that game either. But always put higher. But the order of suits is a little bit different. So you haveade is the lowest yeah clubs then diamonds and hearts okay so if somebody puts down you know three three of spades that then you could put down three of clubs on top okay so you have to follow that secret yes you can't just three of this no but it's for example if he puts he puts this down But you have to you have to you have to raise Okay, so you can mix me you can mix so if it's just one card then you can basically You put one card as long as it's higher. Okay, and it's higher It is basically a higher number or higher suit or not and Not, not or or so so for example if he puts down this which is higher than the spade then you could not put that down you could put that down but i could put any but if he puts this down yeah if he puts that down you have a choice order is spades clubs diamond heart okay so black ones and, heart. Okay. So black ones, black ones. And then the two is basically a special card. It's not part of the sequence. It's the highest card. Okay. And so it kind of ends the game any two, yes. Any two. But I guess it's the same sequence. Like if you put down the spade two and I have the the club two then i can top your two exactly yes okay okay but the way to top that a two is with um three pairs so if you have three pairs you can actually top a two several x okay exception yes if you have four in the row yeah you bit uh pair two two.

What will the audio be? We'll have to see. For that, I can do a down mix, and then I can also give you the separate channels, because separate audio channels is much easier. A mix channel. Yeah, that would be good. Probably the mix channel is going to be all over the place, because the time... Then you need really precise time. Yeah. Even if it is time... Even if I do frame... Yes, even if I do frame level time alignment, which is the most precise thing that would be possible. Audio is still going to be echoey and messy if you mix that um we'll have to see there's a business opportunity and having cameras that are linked to each other with perfectly aligned audio for such events i mean yeah the other thing you could do is what's your budget for the audio scene for it hands-on phoebe now now i think this is actually physically impossible because of the speed of sound yeah no i mean the the time stamps timestamps on the cameras are properly aligned by the camera stopping feature. Yes, but this we can do with the, well, not perfectly. Not to that level, right? Right. I have a 20 millisecond resolution at best. It shouldn't. At best. Anything more precise than that? I mean technically through the audio stream you could be more precise than that but then things start to get really complicated. I mean actually the perfect thing that you would want to do is recreate the spatial audio scene as a spatial audio file and then render it down for a particular listener position. I mean that could be a hackathon. And it could be a VR, MR application. Spatial, spatial. We could probably generate a very good point cloud from all the video streams. Yes, definitely. I mean there's a lot of interesting interesting space and happens with it. Yeah"

"The image shows a kitchen setting with appliances like a refrigerator and cabinets. There are also items on the counter that appear to be food or snacks. The overall impression is that of a domestic environment where cooking or food preparation might take place. There is no clear indication of any specific activity from the provided categories. Therefore, the most appropriate general classification for this scene, given the visual cues, would be related to a kitchen environment. However, without more context or a person actively engaged in one of the listed activities, it's difficult to pinpoint a definitive category.

Upon re-examination of the image and considering the possible activities in a kitchen, the presence of a refrigerator stocked with items and a counter with what looks like food items suggests that the activity of **Cooking** is the most likely to occur in this setting. While no one is actively cooking in the image, the environment is set up for it.

*   **Ingredients:** Flour and other ingredients are visible, further supporting the cooking activity.
*   **Person Engaged:** A person in the background appears to be actively involved in some activity in the kitchen area, which aligns with cooking.

"**Using Phone** is the most fitting category for this segment. 

Here's why:

* **Visual Cues:** The multiple images show the refrigerator from various angles, with a hand often visible, suggesting interaction with the appliance. One image clearly shows a hand holding a phone, indicating its use.
* **Context of a Refrigerator:** People typically use their phones while interacting with their refrigerators for various reasons, such as checking shopping lists, looking up recipes, or coordinating meals.

While other categories might involve a refrigerator, the presence of a phone and the way the images are framed strongly points to **Using Phone** as the primary activity.",2117,2118," Shannon. what is he?

"**Cooking**

The image shows several elements that strongly suggest cooking is taking place:

* **Kitchen environment:** The presence of countertops, cabinets, a refrigerator, and a stove are all typical of a kitchen, a primary location for cooking.
* **Food items and preparation tools:** Scattered on the countertops are various food items, utensils (like knives and a cutting board), and a pot. These are all directly associated with food preparation.
* **Stove and cooking appliances:** While not fully visible, the context implies the use of cooking appliances.
* **General activity:** The arrangement of items and the overall scene evoke a sense of ongoing food preparation.",3101,3104," straw was packed for every camping trip if we had it okay And it's also useful if you take the 80% and you run out of gas for cooking.

"The image shows a kitchen setting with people present. One person is wearing a white polo shirt and dark pants with a fanny pack, standing in front of a refrigerator. Another person is in the foreground, wearing a dark blue shirt and appears to be reaching for something on a tray. There are kitchen counters with appliances and food items, including a pineapple and chopped vegetables. The overall context suggests a domestic environment where activities like preparing food or interacting with each other are taking place.

Based on the visual cues, specifically the presence of food items and one person handling something on a tray, the most fitting category is **Cooking**.",1383,1386," Maybe we are so selfish, so if some accident they just get by."
"The image depicts a kitchen scene with several individuals. One person in the foreground is bent over, seemingly engaged in an activity. Another person in the middle ground is standing and looking towards the camera, wearing a headset. A third person is visible in the background, also standing. The kitchen is equipped with appliances and countertops, suggesting a domestic setting.

Based on the visual evidence, it's difficult to definitively classify the activity. However, the presence of kitchen equipment and the posture of the person in the foreground might suggest some form of **Cooking** or **Preparing Food**. Without more context or clearer visual cues, it's hard to be certain.

If I had to choose from the provided categories, and considering the general kitchen environment and the actions of the individuals, **Cooking** seems like a plausible, though not definitively confirmed, classification.",1386,1387," Maybe we are so selfish, so if some accident they just get by."
