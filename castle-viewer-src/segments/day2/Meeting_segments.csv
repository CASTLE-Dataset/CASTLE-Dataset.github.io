"The most appropriate category for this segment is **Leisure Activities**.

While there are people gathered around a dining table, suggesting a meal or gathering, the broader context of a spacious living area with a large sectional sofa, coffee table, and what appears to be a piano in the background indicates a setting for relaxation and general enjoyment, which falls under leisure activities. The activities in the background, though not explicitly clear, likely involve socializing and enjoying downtime.",1359,2000," Go to the count style and write it. Total carous Oh, yeah. Yeah. You can do it. That's fine. Actually, I think it may be the way to go, som er på vej mot Norsborg. Thank you. I didn't want to play cards. It's not so good.

"The image depicts a gathering of people around a dining table. Most individuals are seated and appear to be engaged in eating or socializing, which falls under the **Eating** category.",2000,1406, I feel like made from concentrate just means this is already pre-mixed Miwadi.
Sitting,1406,3431," Okay, there was this article, you know, like, speaking of this pseudo-psychology, you know, like, about organizational theories and so on. Have you seen a... Well, you don't need to know that. You take a sheet of paper, you literally salt it, you smash it right away and it reduces your stress. It was very well known in some journals of dubious science. So this one... Yeah, actually unbelievable, but okay. So, what I was thinking you mentioned that... I just read an article, I couldn't believe it. See, actually some very wellknown names. So, putting a pepper on me, maybe it reduces my stress. But do the salt. Anyway, and for yourself. So, what I was aiming at, somebody mentioned that we are going to be familiar with the data set and the process. People around us also a little bit more, you know, right? Because you tell colleagues, friends, you know. For a hackathon, maybe it could be a good idea to assign to each team that applies, and we ask people to apply beforehand, a shepherd, somebody who's this or that way involved. And we kind of also organize it as a competition. Competition, you know what I mean? That Shepard is going to be guiding the team. You see where I'm going? And helping them make the best out of what they want, not really telling them what to do. But kind of trying to squeeze. I see some frowns. Probably not a good idea. Let's say Werner takes Team A from Tsinghua and Kahao takes a team from... Oh, you're doing it like American Idol or something? Something like that, yeah. Why not? It's an interesting approach. I like the idea. I'm a bit worried about its implementation. Because many people on this table are going to be very busy these days especially during the time of the attack call. Yeah, we won't have any, actually half the people here won't have a spare time during the attack call. Actually you won't either. Yeah, yeah, yeah. To be fair, we should have some time during the hackathon because if we are busy running around then something went horribly wrong. In most cases it's the general chair that will be busy handing out whiskies and stuff. So you guys should actually have an enjoyable weekend. Well I guess before the to do stuff. Well, I guess before the hackathon, it could be in the preparation phase. It could be a light involvement. And yeah, I guess someone needs to be there anyway during the hackathon. So I think this shepherding idea could work. I'm not sure because you said putting it more in like a competition. I don't think. I mean, there might be very different ideas. So you can't really compare them. So more of a jury kind of thing. Jury jury kind of thing. Which is okay, the TPC co-chair will only be really busy in June, right? Chasing down a thousand missing reviews. Program stuff will happen in July, right? We have lots of time. So much time. We will not know what to do with all that time. You will have four weeks to do the conference. One thing we have to keep in mind, whenever we decide to do a hackathon, poor Vincent will be under pressure to replicate it next year. So it rolls on. Not entirely convinced that this is our immediate problem, because we need to make it work the first time. We need to make it attractive. Some kind of reconstruction, data augmentation, make it very flexible. You can propose some health-related topics like recipe, sanity checking, if you have ways to evaluate public mental health, can you apply them and give people sanity ratings and see whether there's a decline? That was the best of the workshop! Whatever you want, right left to decline. Also interesting is all these if you look at what people do with this tracking of elderly homes are people for example, classic question did they fall? That's not happening here hopefully so far so far nobody fell, I think. Yeah, but the thing is... The jail said it's a dry house, that's why nobody fell so far. We're just gonna screw more banana peels and stuff. But another one, for example, that they were catching, there were commercial products also, like, are people hydrated enough? Yeah, enough of this do they take enough of that yeah and so on and so on this is like what's going to be useful for elderly people independently yeah now we are hitting gold and so on they may have those guys yeah exactly so the data sets we use for that yeah that kind of the challenges totally totally but maybe we get in touch with the cash I have a company that does that the case. I have. You work with a company. But they'd be really interested in sponsoring something like that. Yeah. I mean, you can't do this proxy task. I mean, this is the drug I was supposed to take to keep me alive. So did I get my level of your vital dose of caffeine? Exactly. But it all ties into the recipe generation. What did you put in the meals? The amount of consumption that a person has done. So we pulled that out of the two cameras. Yeah, did we get a variety of nutrition? No, it's such a nice data set. Allergy warnings. Yeah. We have to at least get two years out of this data set before we make a new one. Bigger and longer. With bigger SD cards. With bigger, more everything. I think this is something that is on the agenda for later in the week to see if we had infinite time and infinite money. Well this was done on a massive budget, that's why we're at the end of the world. We had done this in Wheaton, we signed Dublin, short drive, access to more facilities goes by, but it would have been double the price. So we had a rough envelope of 10,000. And I mean, these things are nice. They're not, if we had designed this from scratch, this would look different. But then it would have had around 20,000 it would have had to put together something. We have to have these. No, if we had decided this from scratch, you're talking quite a bit more. Yeah, we can always answer this. We could get this police like a bomb camps and so on.

And playing, I don't know, works and having streams, just having time box annotations. Is this okay? I cannot tell from here. But if everybody does this, can you have an organized annotation? That looks reasonable. reasonable. Well, we can... Yes, we can look into this afterwards. We can do a bit of modifying. If Carl actually remembers to bring the safety pins, then this should be an easy fix. If not, we we'll figure things out Just glue it to his head I hope you have not glue It's very stony It's only going to hurt for a brief moment Yes, yes, yes Then he won't feel anything for a while If Yeah, I know.

Sometimes they You can just plug it in afterwards and hope that it comes back and don't otherwise rinse and repeat. We've done that a bunch. I hate the idea. It's very annoying because it's so unpredictable. I just say this thing every morning because I know I'm not going to have power. And I do it a bunch of times and eventually it turns out okay. I'm not sure if it's based on the power bank because mine had like a first bay. It also happens with wall boards. But today it didn't do any, it was just a line. No, but it also happens when you plug it into the wall."
