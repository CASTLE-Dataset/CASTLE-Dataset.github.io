"**Drinking**

**Reasoning:**

The image shows a person reaching into a refrigerator and pulling out a bag of mozzarella cheese.

* **Visible Food Items:** The image displays various food items like bread, what appears to be a rotisserie chicken, and a foil pan, all suggestive of food preparation or serving.
* **Serving Utensils/Containers:** The presence of a foil pan strongly implies it's being used to hold or transport food, which is a key part of serving.

Talking,3274,3596," The guy was guessing the answers yeah yeah yes it's right twice yeah providing evidence yeah that's what the track did you remember yeah yeah yeah yeah that was what I call summarization it was a bit of a blasphemy to call it yeah yeah exactly i mean i guess you can get to multiple levels you can just provide an explanation and say uh because i i've seen those things on three pictures that's how i come or you really provide a list of evidence and say this is the picture this is the picture yeah then right a meta task was asynchronous yeah i mean you could you could do it in a synchronous thing as well if you have a if you have a system doing it of course if you do that in an interactive way and you have things that the user reasons and the system doesn't know about, then it gets difficult. But at least, I mean, I guess it could be interesting to build a system that also can keep this evidence. So basically that when you provide the answer, you have the things you looked at and say, well, this is the information I used to come up with the answer. I would like to bring an additional aspect to this discussion, because the grand challenge traditionally was always funded by companies and in a way that they also get some output, right? And even though I fully agree with all of you that we need interactive challenges i think for the grand challenge at ac multimedia we could also maybe do some subtasks like labeling for example many people in multimedia are working on food recognition so it could be a collaborative annotation task also and then later on on from that collaborative annotation we could extract metadata and later on maybe use it for the interactive challenges as a ground truth even though it might not be completely correct of course. But as a challenge, if you put it as a challenge, how do you evaluate it? I mean the challenge has kind of this competition character. Is that the hackathon stuff? Yeah, exactly. There's more hackathon, yeah. Let me know what came out of that meeting in 18-month media on the first morning. It was a health-based hackathon. That's what they wanted to do. And we're naturally going to feed into that if we use this data. There's some interesting things we can do about this. For example, all of these things have barcodes on them. Right, right, right. So you can cross-reference this with the international pro doc database and know exactly what this was. And then you can track how much of this is not just fresh by algorithm. How much of this was consumed over what amount of time? And I mean, essentially, it will be difficult to track who actually consumed what."

So if we take it back to the simplest thing there's a ad ad hoc and there's a Q&A set. And then we lead to synchronous challenge, which is ad hoc and Q&A, maybe something else thrown in there, people know well in advance. And that's the first year. And next year we use the same data set, do it again with a grander set of challenges for people. That does look at the recipe creation or whatever it is on the inside we want to do. But we get it kicked off where we can show the success by having a lot of success. Ideally this would then also grow over time. There's a lot of data augmentation. So ideally what I would like to see at some point, which should be very doable for a large fraction of time, so most of us are going to be visible by at least one camera most of the time. We have a trajectory that can be reconstructed just based on the sensor streams that should be on this. So you should not only be able to have the position of every person in time, you could also do the full pose reconstruction, have all the skeleton control points. So you essentially can back project the people into the space, how they were posing, and then do this for all the actiony things interact things even if people want to do Robotic things right you at least have a a homer tears. How did people interact? Yeah, but this is not necessarily very difficult if from a from a Technology or at least from a science point of view, right? So methods to do this exist, it is just going to be work to actually do this. So we will probably... Yeah, so we're not going to release this in February with a high fidelity annotated skeleton post thing, because even if somebody wanted to do this it would just take some time. But wouldn't it be something someone could do for the hackathon? Yes, yes, something like this. I would totally put something like this on the list. Hackathon focus was healthcare. Yes, but even... I mean, you can do two. Post reconstruction is a number of healthcare applications.

Discussing,1474,1580," It's actually some very well-known names they've made. So, putting a pepper on me, maybe it reduces my stress. But do the salt. Anyway, and for yourself. So, what I was aiming at, somebody mentioned that we are going to be familiar with the data set and process. People around us also a little bit more, you know, right? Because you tell colleagues, friends, you know. For a hackathon, maybe it could be a good idea to assign to each team that applies, and we ask people to apply beforehand, a shepherd, somebody who is this or that way involved. And we kind of also organize it as a competition. Competition, you know, meaning that Shepard is gonna be guiding the team. You see where I'm going, gonna helping them make the best out of what they want, not really telling them what to do. But kind of trying to squeeze, I see some froms, probably not a good idea. I was thinking, let's say Werner takes team A from Cinquahua and Kahal takes team from... Oh, you're doing it like American Idol. Yeah, no, that's the same thing. Why not? It's an interesting approach. I like the idea. I'm a bit worried about its implementation because many people on this level are going to be very busy these days especially during the time of that hackathon. Yeah, we won't have any, actually half the people here won't have a spare time during that hackathon. Actually you won't either. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I mean, to be fair... Because it's going to be in a weekend, isn't it? We should ideally have some time during that hackathon because if... should have some time during the back we are busy running around and something went horribly wrong in most cases it's the general chairs that will be busy having out whiskies and stuff so you guys actually Well, I guess before the hackathon it could be in the preparation phase, it could be light involvement. I guess someone needs to be there anyway during the hackathon. So I think this shepherding idea could work. I'm not sure because you said putting it more like a competition. I don't think... I mean, there might be very different ideas, so you can't really compare them. I more of a jury yeah you see culture it will only be really busy in June right chasing down a thousand missing reviews program stuff will happen in July right we should know! You will not know what to do with it. You will have four weeks during the conference. Remember, there's one thing we have to keep in mind. Whatever we decide to do for the hackathon, poor Vincent will be under pressure to replicate it next year. So, it rolls on. Not entirely convinced that this is our immediate problem because we need to make it first we need to make it work the first time you make it attractive but I think some kind of reconstruction documentation make it very flexible yeah you can propose some health related topics like recipe sanity checking I you can evaluate if you have ways to evaluate public mental health can you apply them and give people sanity ratings and see whether there is a decline throughout the days of the workshop whatever you want want. Anything left to decline. Also interesting is all these if you look at what people do with this tracking of elderly homes are people for example, classic question did they fall? That's not happening here hopefully so far nobody fell I think yeah that it's a dry house that's why nobody fell so for example that they were catching there were commercial products also like on it are people hydrated enough yeah they take enough of this they take enough of that yeah this is like what's gonna be really useful for elderly people independent living yeah now we are hitting goal is aware this they may have those guys yeah exactly yeah data has to be useful for that yeah that kind of a challenge is totally ugly maybe we get in have a company that does that as well. Not that I have. We work at a company. But they'd be really interested in sponsoring something like that. I mean, you can do this with proxy tasks. I mean, this is the drug I'm supposed to take to keep me alive. So did I get my lack of health? Your vital dose of caffeine. But it all ties in with the recipe generation. What did you put in the meals? The dramatic assumption that you have a vision person that's doing. Yeah, we pulled it out of the two cameras. Yeah, did we get a variety of nutritional ingredients? It's such a nice data set. Allergy warnings. Yeah. We have to at least get two years out of this data set before we make a new one. Bigger and longer. With bigger SD cards. With bigger, more everything. I think this is something that is on the agenda for later in the week to see if we had infinite time and infinite money. Well this was done on a massive budget, that's why we're at the end of the. If we had done this in Wicklow beside Dublin, short drive, access to more facilities close by, it would have been double the price. We had a rough envelope of 10,000. And I mean these things are nice, they're not, if we had designed this from scratch this this would look different. Then it would have had to have 20,000 put together. We happen to have these. No, if we had designed this from scratch, you're talking quite a bit more. We could get this police-like boot camps. We talked about strapping these on here and we talked about this was the first this was the first uh idea we had to say no in fact you still like that idea the problem with the harness if i have the camera here and i think about for you right you i can't even like that move my eyes and you have no idea where i'm looking at It can be like here. here does it have to be here? at least you see what I'm looking at if somebody builds a tracking lab if it's actually here it will follow your point of view I mean honestly there are like fairly compact sensors for eye tracking I mean not like the one we have in the other room. There's things that could be done. If Luca has a lot of time to build it. If it's feasible and not electrical engineering. So this is probably if we actually need to do this. Electrical engineer.

No, when you go for one card, and then three pairs in a row can beat whatever number. Even can beat number. What we play in Thailand is that we use this instead, three of a kind. Three of a kind is running only three of a kind. So let's say if I go from three number six you must find three number seven, three eight, three nine. But you cannot anything. I see. So it's a little bit different for... Then there is another thing. So I must be in the second to play with you. So let's say if I go for... Let's say we play with 3 people. You play 8.

And you jump in the middle of nowhere. Okay. What if you have 4 of a kind? Yeah. 4 of a kind also beat that. I will go to that. So 4 upper kai can beat any number 2. But cannot beat a pair of 2. Really? Oh, that's not how we... Pair 2 is very high, but 4 bears in a row can beat also a pair of 2. So can this beat that? Only one. So what can I beat? Only 4 bears in a row.

Yes. But then why are these three? the rule of the game. If you have three continuous numbers, three pairs, but continuous, like 8, 9, 10... Three pairs, so... But pairs are bigger than sequences? No, when you go for one card, and then three pairs in a row can beat whatever number. Even can beat number. What we play in Thailand is that we use this instead, three of a kind. Three of a kind is running only three of a kind. So let's say if I go from three number six you must find three number seven, three eight, three nine. But you cannot anything. I see. So it's a little bit different for... Then there is another thing. So I must be in the second to play with you. So let's say if I go for... Let's say we play with 3 people. You play 8. Then I see you play 9. And then I skip it. So I cannot join anymore until I finish this. But if you have 4 pairs in a row, you can jump no matter where you want. 4 pairs in a row? Yes. Let's say 7, 9, 10, and jump. Okay. Then you can jump no matter where you want. Even you can skip, then you jump. Now I want to be in. Okay. So you kind of do a numbers. And you jump in the middle of nowhere. Okay. What if you have 4 of a kind? Yeah. 4 of a kind also beat that. I will go to that. So 4 upper kai can beat any number 2. But cannot beat a pair of 2. Really? Oh, that's not how we... Pair 2 is very high, but 4 bears in a row can beat also a pair of 2. So can this beat that? Only one. So what can I beat? Only 4 bears in a row. Ah, see, so a bit different. Yes, and mainly that is the most complicated things done. Okay. But then we play into the points. So it's not every single game, but you keep playing. Right, yeah, sure.

You lose nothing, she lose nothing, but I got minus four. That is the part I don't really understand. Why do we count point two? Because we play for many games, not one single game. So this is like poker in the long run. So what me and my friend play is that who won gets to be the king and who loses will be the slave. Yeah, that we do also, but that's the simple version, the more complicated version. You go for a run turn, let's say who reaches 100 is the winner. Something like this. Or 50. For this you get negative almost 4 or 8 or lower. I knew Twin Sisters, it it was a different game but they were basically counting points and they played for weeks. They had a book, every time at school they had a break they would start playing and then they just kept going and so they were making some really big numbers. A single game is quite okay but it's losing the evil part of a human. Because then it becomes quite simple. How would you count the points for the last game we just played? So you will get two points. He got one point, I got zero. Oh. Four points, right? Yeah. Okay, that's better. Cool. So, simple game, yeah. If you play single, you don't count the vanity, then no problem. Not really, but then whoever gets to be the king will have to exchange the card with the slave.

No, no, that means... I can play. You start. You start. So now you... It's your turn. I can play anything, right? Yes. Yeah. No, sorry, this is not. Oh. Because the two is not part of the sequence. Really? Yeah, the two is completely modality. That's why we call it the pick. Pick is 2. Oh, okay. Yes. So I lose. Well, you can do the 2 now, right? Yeah, but it's done. Oh, because I'm done. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I see. Okay, right, right, right. Of course. If you work for for the point you lose a lot because first you go the last and then you still have this you got minus two so when it's your turn you should put out uh yeah try to get rid of the two as soon as possible right so it can't be in this sequence no you can't but you can go even go for this or you can go for it here very fast if you see that you don't have a chance to win you have to get rid of it i see i didn't know that yeah no yeah we are learning yeah it's not simple yes it's not simple vietnamese are so complicated sorry oh that's okay i'm going to attempt an airplane are Are you playing also? Let me explain again. Yeah, if you don't mind. Okay. We can do one game and explain. Yes. And basically try to make the logic. Yeah, okay. I think it's easier. So the idea... Let me try to summarize. The idea is to get rid of the cards. Okay, that sounds like many other cards. And basically, whoever's turn this is to do can decide on the format of this. You can put down one card, you can put down a sequence of cards, like three, four, five, six five six seven different suits so it's either you can put down pairs or triples or something like this yes and then everybody else has to follow them follow that pattern ah okay but always put higher but is this like like uh jolly maybe because i don't know that game either okay but always will put higher but the order of suits is a little bit different so you have spade is the lowest yes yeah it's kind of like yes yeah diamonds and hearts it's kind of like japanese game so if somebody puts down uh you know three of of spades then you could put down three of clubs on top okay so you have to follow that sequence so you can't put three just three of this no but if for example if he puts these different colors but you have to have to... You have to raise. You have to raise, okay. So let's say you have another 52 cards. Okay, so you can mix numbers and... So if it's just one card, then you can basically put one card as long as it's higher. Okay, and it's higher... It's basically a higher number or higher shoot. Or, not and. Or. So for example if he puts down this which is higher than the spade, then you could not put that down, you could put that down. But I could put any four. Any four, yes. If he puts that down you have a choice. And the order is spades, clubs, diamonds, hut. Diamond, hut. Okay. So black, red, each red. The two is basically a special card. It's not part of the sequence. It's the highest card. Okay. And so... Any two. It kind of ends the game any two, yes. But I guess it's the same sequence if you put down the spade two and I have the club 2 then I can top your 2. Exactly, yes. Okay, okay. But the way to top a 2 is with 3 pairs. So if you have 3 pairs you can actually top a 2. Several exceptions. If you have 4 in a row, you beat a pair of 2. Sorry, you beat a. If you have three bears in a row, let's say three bears, sorry, a bear of eight, a bear of nine, a bear of ten, you can beat also two. And if you have two twos, like a pair of twos, then you need four pairs to beat them. Four bears in a row. I think these are made by sore losers. These are additions to the rules made by sore losers I cannot have lost I have so good cards I think there's a rule now we go for the simple verses so we don't go for the points then apparently there's more points so complicated and that's the back of the game like all the exceptions you on schedules. There is actually a mountain hub somewhere in Austria that has a sign like a proper bus stop. And it basically says the bus is running every day and then there is just all exceptions. You end up with there is no bus. And when you make a sequence, you don't include number two. so this is like if a second busy the biggest one okay yeah this is the biggest let's say you have this then nothing can be okay yeah even you have yeah for two or four bear one okay so but I think and beat this nothing can beat this no no yes I sequence yeah it's sequence and I guess in the's not like because in some card games yes it's the biggest one in this okay yeah apart from number two yeah so it's not because in some games Ace is either the largest or one, but it. Yeah that's why I think the games sometimes name duos or two or something."
Playing Games,1311,1313," Yeah so I go first and then we go for the clock circle. Okay. So then... Me? Yes. Because in this game, I have very strong cards. Because I have this and this. It's really hard to beat me. I guess it's also very hard to beat you because you're the one who knows the rules. Well, not true. Oh my god. So I can do that, right? Yes, you can do that. I skip. Yes. That's an option too. Okay. So now what could I do on top of it? Queen? You can't. Because he has all three aces. But basically any queen, king, ace with one of these two aces. Yeah, exactly. Well, actually any of them, yes. Right, yes. But could I do any hard color or any... No, not on top of the ace. No, because you need to end in an ace that's higher than the ace of spades. Ah, okay, that's another constraint. No, because basically you have to play something higher, right? Yes, but I... The definition of higher here is that the top card is the higher. It's the top card that determines the height of the... Yes, true, but I understood it's either the number or the color that is higher. The number. But since the ace is the highest. Yeah, but if I have a color that is higher, like a heart... No. That's what I'm saying, if you have... But it needs to be a straight. Like I have a heart, four. Yeah, no, no. Because four is lower. And the end of the straight, so straight means in order. And the top card of the straight needs to be higher than the top card of this straight. So it could only be a ace in this case. It could only be a ace in this case. And he has 3 aces. So if I don't have an ace of this color, because you have all of them, I have a ace. Yes, yes, yes. So let's say even I can choose to skip here. So let's say I choose skip next. So the only one that cannot skip is this guy. No, skip also you can skip but you know you can choose you could choose to do something I can choose to do something so let's say let's watch you skip then you go and if you wanted to do your turn for example then you could basically like if I skip it this is a new turn so I cannot do anything no no but if if if you choose like if you could see that when it's your turn, then you could actually play because you have a... Yes. And then it's your turn to do and you dictate the play basically. He chose to skip. Yes, there you go. So... I'm gonna go for that. So now it's basically a different... We play in pair. Now she, because it's her turn... I could have also started something new? No, because... If everybody skips, it's her turn. And you just need to find a pair bigger than four. Yes. Now it's her... She picks the patterns, basically. So here it just picks the pattern. This is interesting. And I can I can put more, right? You can put a pair. No, you must eat a pair because this pair fall."
Playing Games,1313,1315," Yeah so I go first and then we go for the clock circle. Okay. So then... Me? Yes. Because in this game, I have very strong cards. Because I have this and this. It's really hard to beat me. I guess it's also very hard to beat you because you're the one who knows the rules. Well, not true. Oh my god. So I can do that, right? Yes, you can do that. I skip. Yes. That's an option too. Okay. So now what could I do on top of it? Queen? You can't. Because he has all three aces. But basically any queen, king, ace with one of these two aces. Yeah, exactly.

It's the top card that determines the height of the... Yes, true, but I understood it's either the number or the color that is higher. The number. But since the ace is the highest. Yeah, but if I have a color that is higher, like a heart... No. That's what I'm saying, if you have... But it needs to be a straight. Like I have a heart, four. Yeah, no, no. Because four is lower. And the end of the straight, so straight means in order. And the top card of the straight needs to be higher than the top card of this straight. So it could only be a ace in this case. It could only be a ace in this case. And he has 3 aces. So if I don't have an ace of this color, because you have all of them, I have a ace. Yes, yes, yes. So let's say even I can choose to skip here. So let's say I choose skip next. So the only one that cannot skip is this guy. No, skip also you can skip but you know you can choose you could choose to do something I can choose to do something so let's say let's watch you skip then you go and if you wanted to do your turn for example then you could basically like if I skip it this is a new turn so I cannot do anything no no but if if if you choose like if you could see that when it's your turn, then you could actually play because you have a... Yes. And then it's your turn to do and you dictate the play basically. He chose to skip. Yes, there you go. So... I'm gonna go for that. So now it's basically a different... We play in pair. Now she, because it's her turn... I could have also started something new? No, because... If everybody skips, it's her turn. And you just need to find a pair bigger than four. Yes. Now it's her...

Ah, okay, that's another constraint. No, because basically you have to play something higher, right? Yes, but I... The definition of higher here is that the top card is the higher. It's the top card that determines the height of the... Yes, true, but I understood it's either the number or the color that is higher. The number. But since the ace is the highest. Yeah, but if I have a color that is higher, like a heart... No. That's what I'm saying, if you have... But it needs to be a straight. Like I have a heart, four. Yeah, no, no. Because four is lower. And the end of the straight, so straight means in order. And the top card of the straight needs to be higher than the top card of this straight. So it could only be a ace in this case. It could only be a ace in this case. And he has 3 aces. So if I don't have an ace of this color, because you have all of them, I have a ace. Yes, yes, yes. So let's say even I can choose to skip here. So let's say I choose skip next. So the only one that cannot skip is this guy. No, skip also you can skip but you know you can choose you could choose to do something I can choose to do something so let's say let's watch you skip then you go and if you wanted to do your turn for example then you could basically like if I skip it this is a new turn so I cannot do anything no no but if if if you choose like if you could see that when it's your turn, then you could actually play because you have a... Yes. And then it's your turn to do and you dictate the play basically. He chose to skip. Yes, there you go. So... I'm gonna go for that. So now it's basically a different... We play in pair. Now she, because it's her turn... I could have also started something new? No, because... If everybody skips, it's her turn. And you just need to find a pair bigger than four. Yes. Now it's her... She picks the patterns, basically. So here it just picks the pattern. This is interesting. And I can I can put more, right? You can put a pair. No, you must eat a pair because this pair fall."
Playing Games,1316,1365," Yeah so I go first and then we go for the clock circle. Okay. So then... Me? Yes. Because in this game, I have very strong cards. Because I have this and this.

*   **People interacting casually:** The individuals in the image appear to be gathered in a relaxed manner, possibly for a social gathering.
*   **The thermal imaging device:** While it could be for a specific experiment, in this context, it could also be part of a hobby or shared interest that falls under leisure.

"The most fitting category for this segment is **Playing Games**.

Here's why:

*   **Poker Chips:** The presence of poker chips on the table strongly indicates a game is being played.
*   **People Gathered:** The people are gathered around a table, a common setting for games.

Therefore, the most appropriate classification is **Eating**.",1346,1441," once once the streams are time aligned youigned, you get like a 4x4 boxed thing, right? With all the 15 streams concurrently. We could have a 4-container with all different streams. No, but the thing is you want to be able to look at all of them, right? So just a 4x4 video mosaic kind of thing, probably even in a time-lapse version. So you can just look at this and then, yeah, and then identify. We need a 16 a 16k sorry no it's going to be down rest right so this this will help you identify we should have the audio how can we hear i think you just need to turn them down and then mix i can down mix all the other we'll have to say audio is difficult we'll have to to see about things i can also give you 16 audio channels and then you can talk between them. We'll have to figure this out but this is essentially going to be a index to help you to identify things you might want to have a closer look at and then you can have the original of that."

No, I mean the time stamps on the cameras are properly aligned by the camera stopper. Ah, yes, but this we can do with the... Well, not perfectly. Not to that level, right?

Vậy nên nếu anh là thắng, và lúc này tôi muốn, in this game you win so you are the king. Right so so if you were the king right and this turn I won you immediately be the slave. So it doesn't matter I come the list or the second list, I still be the slave. You need to, if you were, if you're a king you have to always win. More pressure. Iược rồi, anh có 3. Nguyên đi trước.

Tại vì các bạn có thể chơi trở lại, hoặc là những gì đó. Vậy nên khó nhận ra các bạn sẽ chơi tiếp theo. Vì vậy, các bạn nên đi vào số 2 đầu tiên. Ví dụ, 2 đá. Để cho nó ra khỏi 2 đá.

"The image depicts a blurred scene, possibly a gathering or a party. While several people appear to be present, the motion blur makes it difficult to discern specific activities. However, the presence of what looks like a decorated Christmas tree (indicated by the blurred lights on the right side of the image) and people gathered together suggests a social occasion. Without clearer details, it's challenging to pinpoint a single activity.

However, given the context of a social gathering, ""Leisure Activities"" is the most fitting general category. It could encompass a variety of things people do in such a setting, from conversing to simply enjoying each other's company.
