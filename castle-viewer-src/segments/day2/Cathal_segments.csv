"This image depicts a scene that is difficult to classify definitively into one of the provided categories. However, based on the visible elements:

* **Kitchen setting:** The presence of countertops, cabinets, and what appears to be a stove or oven suggests a kitchen environment.
* **People present:** Several people are visible, some appearing to be engaged in activity within the kitchen.

Given these observations, the most fitting general category would be **Cooking**. While specific actions like chopping, stirring, or baking aren't explicitly clear, the context of a kitchen with people implies the preparation of food.

That's the default approach. Is there something you want to do that's better or more novel than that? Does anybody have any ideas? Let's worry about the challenge first and the hackathon second, I think. Well, the question is, does the challenge have to have one single task or maybe multiple ones? It's up to us. There's a workshop and, well, no, I imagine there will be an associated workshop and a grand challenge tied to the workshop. I vote multiple. vote multiple. Yeah.

The usual grand challenge formats which I think we should stick to at least for the part that we label as common talent, is an asynchronous operation. You get your data, you get your task, you get your time to process, to do whatever it is you think you need to do to solve the task, you send in your results, you get your scores back, and there's going to be result presentation of everybody or the top scoring teams. It's not very alike to LSE and VBS. Yeah, I mean this is something we can do on top of this. That we have a session where something happens live. I think that's what they literally asked us. I mean, that's one thing that makes this format very unique, this interaction. And why is it kind of, I think, interesting that we look at, right, some form of interaction in the age of these conversational systems, because these are conversational systems, being from the beginning. So we can do some kind of data mining where they build a system, more like exploration system. And then at the challenge we will have very specific questions for that. For example, regarding group dynamics. So they will have to build a system that can visualize the group dynamics and show some kind of interaction like more and very user experience based and then at the challenge we do we ask some question live and they have to use the system to answer that it's like uh who did i talk to the most today or something like that but these questions are only released at the challenge live. I would just not limit it to something like this because the barrier of entry for these sort of things is very high. So you need a complete stack. I think we can do, yeah.

For example, regarding group dynamics. So they will have to build a system that can visualize the group dynamics and show some kind of interaction like more and very user experience based and then at the challenge we do we ask some question live and they have to use the system to answer that it's like uh who did i talk to the most today or something like that but these questions are only released at the challenge live. I would just not limit it to something like this because the barrier of entry for these sort of things is very high. So you need a complete stack. I think we can do, yeah.

You get your data, you get your task, you get your time to process, to do whatever it is you think you need to do to solve the task, you send in your results, you get your scores back, and there's going to be result presentation of everybody or the top scoring teams.

Fine, fine, they're both okay.'s multiple retrieval if we don't go for a full conversation but conversational search for example that's pretty much how you formulate and evaluate query sorted. You provide a bit of information that people stop looking, that it's funny, you know, on the microphone people say okay, nobody finding, and then typically Werner or you kind of says, aha, additional piece of information, you know. Like that girl running up the hill to the father towards the flag. Then you provide the next bit of information but what is what is the target is it a pure retrieval task as in find the end of this conversational chain for this example that's easier or is it a you need you need to somehow summarize this conversation into two phrases uh evaluating summer is super difficult but outcomes maybe was bad.

But as a challenge, if you put it as a challenge, how do you evaluate it? I mean, the challenge has kind of this competition character. Is that not the hackathon stuff? Yeah, exactly exactly because looking at looking at what came out of that meeting in html media on the first morning it was a health based hackathon that's what they wanted to do and we're naturally going to feed into that if we use this data we don't have to right things we can we can do about this i mean for example all of these things have barcodes on them. Right, right. So you can cross-reference this with the international product database and know exactly what this was. And then you can track how much of this happens to the fresh hook by Apple. How much of this was consumed over what amount of time. And, I mean, essentially it will be difficult to track who actually consumed what but the the methodology would be applicable if you have a smaller group of people for a for your health tracking you can see okay what did I actually eat whether what is my nutritional profile just based on things I've seen this sort of stuff. I think this would be fascinating for hackathons. Yeah, I like that. It would be very difficult for the grand challenge because how do you evaluate this? Because we are not all secretly keeping track and having ground truth. Maybe just one comment to this, becauseVid also does this part-based evaluation, right? Where they evaluate with some manual effort 10% of the submissions and then approximate how much there will be. Yeah, if you do that, for example, with product annotations, I mean, even 10% is a crazy amount of work. So there are some grand challenges if you look at it.

Where they evaluate with some manual effort 10% of the submissions and then approximate how much there will be. Yeah, if you do that, for example, with product annotations, I mean, even 10% is a crazy amount of work. So there are some grand challenges if you look at it. The way I kind of participated also in some and the one that we won in New Yorker, Melange, that was 10 years ago with Monza. That one was bought by IBM and because they were based in New York, you know, like they wanted to really... This is the definition of Grand Challenge, we wanna show in New York, using all this wealth of social media data, from different perspectives. So, competing teams had totally different solutions, very interesting, somebody focused on the fashion of the city, you know, like, city of fashion. Right. Recommender systems, location recommender systems, and so on and so on. So, when speaking about Grand Challenges, they have also tradition of these open-ended tasks. So, in that sense, what we kind of discussed now as a hackathon could also fit Grand Challenge. But there the checking wasn't on individual items whether they're correct or not. It was really on the overall look and feel of the thing. But this is the more you have a jury that looks at this sort of stuff and they... The look and the feel of the thing is more than... They essentially grade the creativity and the quality of the output and... Presentation also during the conference. Yeah, I mean this is also something that would be interesting to do. but I guess this would be two tracks.

What can we do, you know, let's start moving into building some systems that actually use it for something useful. You know, either tracking fashion trends, Hong Kong people did this, or location recommenders, what we did, and a few other groups as well on and so on and so on I'm just like saying here There are many possibilities. It doesn't have to be really classic computer vision segmentation Yeah, that's correct. You can also check our fashion. Maybe find out who is wearing the same shirt or something.

"**Talking** 

The individuals in the image appear to be engaged in conversation around a table, indicating a social interaction.",3571,3604," call it as much as evidence yeah exactly i mean i guess you can get to moderate levels you can just provide an explanation and say uh because i i have seen those things on three pictures that's how i come or you really provide a list of evidence and say this is the picture this is yeah that's that's asynchronous then right i met the task was a synchronous yeah i mean you could you could do it in a synchronous thing as well if you have a if you have a system doing it of course if you do that in an interactive way and you have things that that the user and the system doesn't know about, then it is difficult. But at least, I mean, I guess it would be interesting to build a system that also can keep this evidence. So basically that when you provide the answer, you have the things we looked at and say, well is the information i used to to come up with the answer i would like to bring an additional aspect to this discussion because the the grand challenge traditionally was always funded by companies and in a way that they also get some output right and even though i fully agree with all of you that we need interactive challenges i think for the grand challenge at acl multimedia we could also maybe do some subtasks like labeling for example many people in multimedia are working on food recognition so it could be a collaborative annotation task also and then later on from, from that collaborative annotation, we could extract metadata, and later on maybe use it for the interactive challenges as a ground truth, even though it might not be completely correct, of course. But as a challenge, if you put it as a challenge, how do you evaluate it? I mean, the challenge has kind of this competition character. Is that not the hackathon stuff? Yeah, exactly exactly because looking at looking at what came out of that meeting in html media on the first morning it was a health based hackathon that's what they wanted to do and we're naturally going to feed into that if we use this data we don't have to right things we can we can do about this i mean for example all of these things have barcodes on them. Right, right. So you can cross-reference this with the international product database and know exactly what this was. And then you can track how much of this happens to the fresh hook by Apple. How much of this was consumed over what amount of time. And, I mean, essentially it will be difficult to track who actually consumed what but the the methodology would be applicable if you have a smaller group of people for a for your health tracking you can see okay what did I actually eat whether what is my nutritional profile just based on things I've seen this sort of stuff. I think this would be fascinating for hackathons. Yeah, I like that. It would be very difficult for the grand challenge because how do you evaluate this?

And I'm just going to get a few training images to learn the properties of the camera. And it's like, OK, what was the focal length? What are the sensor properties? And then we have the images.

So there comes another person that says, oh you, if you can show us this and this and this So there were like five six people that came and for two days people were busy really And actually they were even kind of sometimes describing it very vaguely, but they were like really There must be something that we are not seeing there because otherwise we would be probably using it If you find something useful in it when it comes to advertisement and so on, please also let us know. So, but I'm going with this one. We have this data now, so for a hackathon I think it would be handy to give some guidelines, kind of give some ideas, hey look, invite some people from our community that have been working on food like tatsen, chombach and so on and so on. They kind of say, hey look, this is what community has been doing, some people that are doing this, could be this direction, doesn't have to be the same, you know like and then give some other hints what people use it for, recipes you know like there is this one million recipe you know, we attempted to cook Asian food in Ireland, but I'm quite sure we, and it tasted great, but it's probably not the original ingredients."
Sitting,669,713," it's kind of you have to pay a tax to put anything in a public space as an advertisement. Apparently in many cities people just like hang something hoping nobody's gonna see. There are even strict regulations on for example light pollution you know like if you put a light symbol there, well it may be for people who are sleeping. So anyhow the head of and he was really like, hey look, there are these panoramas but we have no idea what they can be used for and we are totally willing to invest this much and this much, you know, like if we see kind of evidence that you can reliably detect automatically all the advertisements in public spaces.

Discussing,713,714," Close enough. Close enough, yeah, close enough. That's really great. What did you replace with what? So I think that kind of stuff. And then kind of, that's hackathon. And for, I think for Grand Challenge, at least, I think we need to keep some interaction because because if you look what most of the people do like in a NeurIPSY, iCLEARS, computer vision conferences and so on it's mostly fully automatic stuff and this is like sports event it's fun it's a I think that's some kind of joy that we are bringing to the table. Of a conference, any conference. But then but then again, Interactive has a high barrier of entry, so it should not be exclusive. Yeah, I think what's coming out from the conversation is there's an asynchronous task and there's a synchronous task. The asynchronous task is going to be lower barrier to entry. Any student in any university that can get his hands on 20 terabytes or her hands on 20 terabytes of this space can process the data set can process 24 queries or whatever we decide to do send in results pooled relevant judgments submission back or whatever right answers back results back and those that want to do the interactive element will come to the actual conference definitely right and they will um take part in an interactive um grand challenge which is part of the conference that's why they asked us to do it right they wanted the VBS and the LSE in the cut in because it's not so we take it back to the simplest thing there's a ad hoc hoc and there's a Q&A set. And then we lead to a synchronous challenge, which is ad hoc and Q&A, maybe something else thrown in there. People know well in advance. And that's the first year. And next year we use the same data set, do it again with a grander set of challenges for people. That does look at the recipe creation or whatever it is on each side we want to do but we get it kicked off where we can show the success by having what is success 10 participants is that success for us ideally this would then also grow over time yes there's a lot of of data that well there's a lot of data augmentation that can be done yes so ideally what I would like to see at some point, which should be very doable for a large fraction of time, so most of us are going to be visible by at least one camera most of the time. We have a trajectory that can be reconstructed just based on the sensor streams that should be on this. So you should not only be able to have the position of every person, you could also do the full pose reconstruction, have all the skeleton control points. So you essentially can back project the people into the space, how they were posing, and then do this for all the action-y things, interact-y things."

Any student in any university that can get his hands on 20 terabytes or her hands on 20 terabytes of this space can process the data set can process 24 queries or whatever we decide to do send in results pooled relevant judgments submission back or whatever right answers back results back and those that want to do the interactive element will come to the actual conference definitely right and they will um take part in an interactive um grand challenge which is part of the conference that's why they asked us to do it right they wanted the VBS and the LSE in the cut in because it's not so we take it back to the simplest thing there's a ad hoc hoc and there's a Q&A set. And then we lead to a synchronous challenge, which is ad hoc and Q&A, maybe something else thrown in there. People know well in advance. And that's the first year. And next year we use the same data set, do it again with a grander set of challenges for people. That does look at the recipe creation or whatever it is on each side we want to do but we get it kicked off where we can show the success by having what is success 10 participants is that success for us ideally this would then also grow over time yes there's a lot of of data that well there's a lot of data augmentation that can be done yes so ideally what I would like to see at some point, which should be very doable for a large fraction of time, so most of us are going to be visible by at least one camera most of the time. We have a trajectory that can be reconstructed just based on the sensor streams that should be on this. So you should not only be able to have the position of every person, you could also do the full pose reconstruction, have all the skeleton control points.

Sitting,1212,1225," like American Idol. it's an interesting approach I I like the idea I'm a bit worried about its implementation because people on the table are gonna be very busy these days especially during the time of that hackathon. Yeah we won't we won't have any actually half the people here won't have any spare time during that hackathon. Actually you won't either. Yeah, yeah, yeah. To be fair, we should have to figure out that yes sometime during the attack because if uh if we are we are busy running around then something might already be wrong well in most cases it's the the general chairs that will be busy handing out whiskeys and stuff during the conference um so you guys should actually have an enjoyable week in reality so you would have time to do do stuff. Well, I guess before the hackathon, it could be the preparation phase. It could be light involvement. And yeah, I guess someone needs to be there anyway during the hackathon. So I think this shepherding idea could work. I'm not sure because you said putting it more like a competition. I don't think, I mean, there might be very different ideas, so you can't really compare them. So more of a jury kind of thing which is ok the TPC co-chairs will only be really busy in June right chasing down a thousand missing reviews or something the program stuff will happen in July you'll have lots of time lots of time so time. You will not know what to do with it. You will have four weeks to do the conference. But okay, remember, there's one thing we have to keep in mind. Whatever we decide to do for the hackathon, poor Vincent will be under pressure to replicate it next year. So, it rolls on. Not entirely convinced that this is our immediate problem, on we need to make it first we need to make it work the first time need to make it attractive with all the people who typically take part or not taking part but I think some kind of reconstruction they talk maintain I love it make it very flexible yeah you can propose some health related topics like you know recipe recipe generations beautiful i don't know if you can evaluate if you if you have ways to evaluate you know public mental health you know can you apply them and and give people sanity ratings and see whether there's a decline anything left to decline Yeah, yeah. It's also interesting. Yeah, it's also interesting. Yeah, it's also interesting. No, whatever you want. Anything left to decline. It's also interesting is all these if you look at what people do with this tracking of elderly homes and our people for example, classic question did they fall? That's not happening here hopefully so far nobody fell I think yeah but the channel said it's a dry house that's why nobody fell it's a dry house remember through more banana peels and stuff but another one for example that they were catching and there were commercial products also like on it are people hydrated enough yeah yeah this is like what's gonna be really useful for elderly people independent living yeah now where they won't wear this they may have those guys so the data sets really useful for that so that's kind of a challenge is nice I have a company you have a company that does that as well not i have we work with a company that does that um but they'd be really interested in sponsoring something like that right yeah i mean you can do this with proxy tasks i mean this is this is the drug i'm supposed to take to keep me alive so did i get my level of your your vital dose exactly but it all ties in with the recipe generation what did you put in the meals? The amount of consumption that each individual person has done. Can we pull that out of the two cameras or this camera? If we get a variety of nutritional ingredients. It's such a nice data set. Allergy warnings. We have to at least get two years out of this data set before we make a new one then bigger and longer yeah with bigger sd cards with with bigger more everything i i think this is this is something that is on the agenda for later in the week yeah this was to see what if we had infinite time with infinite money yeah well this was done on a massive budget that's why we're at the end of the world. If we had done this in Wicklow beside Dublin, short drive, access to more facilities close by, but it would have been double the price. So we had a rough envelope of 10,000. And I mean, these things are... We happen to have those already, right? These things are nice. They're not... If we had designed this from scratch, this would look different. Then I would have had to have 20,000 that I would have had to put together or something. We happen to have these. If we had designed this from scratch, we're talking quite a bit more.

Yeah we won't we won't have any actually half the people here won't have any spare time during that hackathon. Actually you won't either. Yeah, yeah, yeah. To be fair, we should have to figure out that yes sometime during the attack because if uh if we are we are busy running around then something might already be wrong well in most cases it's the the general chairs that will be busy handing out whiskeys and stuff during the conference um so you guys should actually have an enjoyable week in reality so you would have time to do do stuff. Well, I guess before the hackathon, it could be the preparation phase. It could be light involvement. And yeah, I guess someone needs to be there anyway during the hackathon. So I think this shepherding idea could work. I'm not sure because you said putting it more like a competition. I don't think, I mean, there might be very different ideas, so you can't really compare them. So more of a jury kind of thing which is ok the TPC co-chairs will only be really busy in June right chasing down a thousand missing reviews or something the program stuff will happen in July you'll have lots of time lots of time so time. You will not know what to do with it. You will have four weeks to do the conference. But okay, remember, there's one thing we have to keep in mind. Whatever we decide to do for the hackathon, poor Vincent will be under pressure to replicate it next year. So, it rolls on.

To be fair, we should have to figure out that yes sometime during the attack because if uh if we are we are busy running around then something might already be wrong well in most cases it's the the general chairs that will be busy handing out whiskeys and stuff during the conference um so you guys should actually have an enjoyable week in reality so you would have time to do do stuff. Well, I guess before the hackathon, it could be the preparation phase. It could be light involvement. And yeah, I guess someone needs to be there anyway during the hackathon. So I think this shepherding idea could work. I'm not sure because you said putting it more like a competition. I don't think, I mean, there might be very different ideas, so you can't really compare them.

I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like that for the actual challenge, we can have several subtasks. So first to tracks, the interactive thing, the stuff is happening there on site, and the more traditional USEND send us results we're going to tell you how well you did non interactive stuff for the for the former it is it will probably have to be reasonably similar to the two interactive challenges we've already been doing so have some some instance retrieval and have some question answering with a human in the loop and we would like to attract vps teams and lsc teams right yes and and we will do judging maybe with a few people similar yeah similar yes perfect perfect we are the judges point of view uh from an infrastructure point of view also how the tasks are designed how the tasks are presented it would be the exact same thing as as a vbs analysis and then it could later go to the vps and lsc but for the first time yeah it's push this into one of those possibly. Which makes the communication to the people reasonably easy. I mean what we might want to do anyway is just write a brief, if you have never heard of VPS and LSE, this is how it works kind of document which we're missing anyway so onboarding new teams is hard because you essentially have to chronologically read a decade of publications to see how the stuff actually works but that would be the interactive one and then there's a bunch of logistics we need to figure out but this is essentially just work so this So this is not difficult. And for non-interactive, we could do almost the same tasks, but asynchronously. Yes, plus more stuff. So some of the things that we've said that we can actually evaluate that are different type of tasks, as in reconstruct this view from this point. So I actually took the picture, but I'm not showing you the picture. Also point of view like region of interest, slash salient objects, eye gaze from another person's point of view. That might be difficult to evaluate because we don't have the ground truth. So this is more of a hackathon kind of thing. hear there we can look at it and see if it is reasonable but if two teams submit something similar we don't have a precise metric to see is how good is this because otherwise somebody would actually need to have the eye track right so this would be the so that definitely the the question non-s question answering instance retrieval stuff in both tracks. Yeah. And the non-interactive would have additional tracks for reconstruction things that you could not reasonably do interactively. That also would not necessarily need human input because it's more of an algorithmic. Like recipes or something. Yes, regenerate this recipe, regenerate this schedule for this person. Count the number of this person did this time or on this day this kind of action was performed. Is sort of thing. This is still sort of kind of question and answer-y. I would really want to do the visual reconstruction thing for it also so the computer vision people also have an interesting task. Things like that. thinking about the reconstruction maybe something we should do while"

So first to tracks, the interactive thing, the stuff is happening there on site, and the more traditional USEND send us results we're going to tell you how well you did non interactive stuff for the for the former it is it will probably have to be reasonably similar to the two interactive challenges we've already been doing so have some some instance retrieval and have some question answering with a human in the loop and we would like to attract vps teams and lsc teams right yes and and we will do judging maybe with a few people similar yeah similar yes perfect perfect we are the judges point of view uh from an infrastructure point of view also how the tasks are designed how the tasks are presented it would be the exact same thing as as a vbs analysis and then it could later go to the vps and lsc but for the first time yeah it's push this into one of those possibly. Which makes the communication to the people reasonably easy. I mean what we might want to do anyway is just write a brief, if you have never heard of VPS and LSE, this is how it works kind of document which we're missing anyway so onboarding new teams is hard because you essentially have to chronologically read a decade of publications to see how the stuff actually works but that would be the interactive one and then there's a bunch of logistics we need to figure out but this is essentially just work so this So this is not difficult. And for non-interactive, we could do almost the same tasks, but asynchronously. Yes, plus more stuff. So some of the things that we've said that we can actually evaluate that are different type of tasks, as in reconstruct this view from this point. So I actually took the picture, but I'm not showing you the picture. Also point of view like region of interest, slash salient objects, eye gaze from another person's point of view. That might be difficult to evaluate because we don't have the ground truth. So this is more of a hackathon kind of thing. hear there we can look at it and see if it is reasonable but if two teams submit something similar we don't have a precise metric to see is how good is this because otherwise somebody would actually need to have the eye track right so this would be the so that definitely the the question non-s question answering instance retrieval stuff in both tracks. Yeah. And the non-interactive would have additional tracks for reconstruction things that you could not reasonably do interactively. That also would not necessarily need human input because it's more of an algorithmic. Like recipes or something. Yes, regenerate this recipe, regenerate this schedule for this person. Count the number of this person did this time or on this day this kind of action was performed. Is sort of thing. This is still sort of kind of question and answer-y. I would really want to do the visual reconstruction thing for it also so the computer vision people also have an interesting task.

"The most fitting category for this image is **Eating**.

Here's why:

*   **Visible food and plates:** The table is covered in used plates with remnants of food (croissants, crumbs), indicating a meal has been consumed.
*   **Mugs with drinks:** Several mugs appear to have held coffee or tea, consistent with a meal.
*   **Utensils:** A knife and fork are present on a plate.
*   **People at the table:** While not the primary focus, the presence of people at a table laden with food strongly suggests a meal setting.

While there's a list on the paper, it's not the dominant activity depicted. The overall scene screams ""post-meal"" or ""during a meal.""",2303,2311, Chess or equivalent.

"Based on the image provided, the most fitting category is **Cleaning**.

Here's why:

*   **Washing Machine:** The presence of a washing machine strongly suggests laundry, which is a form of cleaning.
*   **Laundry Basket:** The laundry basket is another clear indicator of laundry and cleaning activities.
*   **General Appearance of a Utility/Laundry Room:** The overall setup with cabinets, a microwave (often found in utility spaces), and what appears to be a utility sink or counter points to a room dedicated to household chores, including cleaning.

While other activities *could* theoretically happen in such a space, the objects present most directly relate to cleaning.",3294,3296," All good. Første gang.

"The image shows a dining room set with a table, chairs, and place settings. This suggests that the room is used for eating or entertaining. While there are no people in the image, the presence of a set table implies a meal is either about to happen or has just concluded.

"**Cleaning** 

Here's why:

* **Washing machine:** The presence of a washing machine strongly suggests laundry activities, which fall under the broader category of cleaning.
* **Laundry basket:** The green laundry basket further reinforces the idea of clothes being cleaned or waiting to be cleaned.
* **Cleaning supplies:** While not explicitly visible in all frames, the context of a washing machine and laundry basket implies the availability of cleaning supplies.

While other interpretations are possible, the most direct and evident activity suggested by the visual cues is cleaning, specifically laundry.",352,359,

"The image shows a man with a head-mounted camera, pointing at himself. He is wearing a red sweater. The background includes a white wall with electrical outlets and a cupboard. There is also a laundry basket with a dark object inside.

While the man's specific activity isn't explicitly stated, the presence of a head-mounted camera and his gesture suggest he might be recording content or engaging in a personal project. Given the options, the most fitting category would be **Leisure Activities** as it encompasses personal pursuits that are not work-related.

However, if we were to interpret the scene more broadly, the act of being recorded could also be related to a task or hobby. Without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact activity.

If the man is indeed recording himself for a personal vlog or a similar activity, it would fall under **Leisure Activities**.

Reading,1045,1167," inquired the way to such and such a place of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to know him. When they saw him coming, they would tug their owners into doorways and up courts. They would wag their tails as though they said, no eye at all is better than an evil eye, Dark Master. But what did Scrooge care? It's the very thing he liked, to edge his way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep his distance, was what the knowing ones called nuts to Scrooge. Once upon a time, of all the good days in the year, year on Christmas Eve old Scrooge sat busy in his counting house. It was a cold bleak biting weather foggy with all and he could hear the people in the court outside go wheezing up and down beating their hands upon their breasts and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The city clocks had only just gone three, and it was quite dark already. It had not been light all day, and the candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense without that, although the court was... Okay, that's so complicated. The fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense without that, Although the court was a that's so complicated the fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole and was so dense without that although the court was of the narrowest the houses opposite were mere phantoms to see the dingy cloud come drooping down obscuring everything one might have thought that nature lived hard by and was brewing on a large scale the door of scrooge's's county house was open so that he could keep an eye on his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire but the clerk's fire was so very much smaller that it looked like just one coal. But he couldn't replenish it for Scrooge kept the coal box in his own room and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his white comforter, he tried to warm himself at the candle, in which effort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed."

Therefore, the most appropriate classification for this scene is **Eating**.",1360,1503," Good numbers. Once the streams are time aligned, you get like a 4x4 boxed thing with all the 15 streams concurrently. We could have a FB4 container with all different streams. But the thing is you want to be able to look at all of them right so just a 4x4 video mosaic kind of thing probably probably even in a time-lapse version so you can just look at this and then yeah we need a 16k screen no it's gonna be, right? So this will help you identify... Sorry, but we still have the audio. How can we hear 16... I think you're going to turn it down in the mix. Turn it down in the mix. Audio is difficult. To see about things, I can also give you 16 audio channels, and you can talk between them. We'll have to figure this out. But this is essentially going to be an index to help you to identify things you might want to have a closer look at and then you can have the original of that. And this could be an MP4 container, right right? This is a different elementary streams and different audio streams. I'm not sure that's easy to handle. Well I'm probably not gonna build video containers with multiple video streams because there's player well not sure if your default video I would be able to handle that. Although, VLC handles pretty much any format under the sun. To be honest, I think it would be very cool to at any moment be able to pause the video and then switch the video stream to a different camera. It could be a reduced resolution. And then have exactly that view from that point. Instead of having to have multiple videos open at the same time. No, you don't have to have multiple videos open at the same time. You're going to get the preview video that is down-rendered into all the things. Because the problem is, is if I give you one container then"

Talking,1867,1870," Yeah, but it sounds great. Yeah. Then you need really precise timing. Yeah. Even if I do frame level time alignment, which is the most precise thing that would be possible, audio is still going to be echoey and messy and things if you mix all of that. So we'll have to see. There's a business opportunity in having cameras that are linked to each other with perfectly aligned audio for such events. I mean the other thing you could do is basically build a spatial audio scene for it. It depends on Phoebe. Now I think this is actually physically impossible because of the speed of sound. No I mean the I mean, the timestamps on the cameras are properly aligned by the camera stocking to each other. Aha, yes, but this we can do with the, well, not perfect. Not to that level, right? Right. You know the way audio mismatched by... I have a 20 millisecond resolution. Okay, it ist schon... as a spatial audio file and then render it down for a particular listener position. I mean that could be a hackathon. And it could be a VR, MR. Spatial audio. We could probably generate a very good point cloud from all the video streams. Yes, definitely. There's a lot of interesting spatial audio that then one I would even but let's see what let's see what the budget is for castle too sigam have a lot of money apparently let's make castle one work first we are now mentioning what we should do and how much work it takes we really have to think then of some european grants for this and i think this is yeah so Exactly. To get some people to do this because this is like total... Mēs varam izmantot eurotekšu grāti, un mēs varam izmantot, ka ir ļoti daudz, kas mēs varam izmantot. Mēs domājam, ka mēs varam izmantot, ka ir ļoti daudz, kas mēs varam izmantot. Jā, es atceru. Šķiet, audio 2. and there's our applications there's calls coming up next fall so the call opens next fall no the call closes next fall so it will open probably sometime during summer i mean the work program is not agreed yet because well we have a working commission since last weekend so okay that might be interesting yeah, that's on the draft, we need it. How big are these goals? Not decided yet? Well, there is a thing in the draft work program that I've seen that talks about the virtual world partnership which is not there yet, which I'm sure it's there yet so I'm not sure if the budget they calculated is already assuming but we'll see okay and Luca you checked out other data sets before right other similar data sets you found one you said there there are well there are first person data sets, first person video data sets for various things. The most notable ones that have overlap with what we're doing is Epic Kitchens. The applications used a very similar setup when they had head mount GoCros with people doing things in their own kitchen. Okay, not in the same room. One person preparing foods in a kitchen and you get, there has been extensions with also third person cameras that augment this and then you also get a lot of very fine grained annotations, spatial decorals and actions. This has been used for a lot of stuff. And how many people and for how long A lot of people. It's about... A lot of people, I guess. Probably about two dozen people, something like this. I'm not entirely sure. Every month or so I get paper to read. Different, different. Yeah, but I mean, so... I've never seen this. It's very well known. It's a few years old at this point. It is quite well known. It is very limited in domain, but within that domain it does a lot. It's pretty much like a film. But also cleaning dishes? Well, there's various kitchen related activities. I don't know exactly. There are also fine-grained annotations. Chopping, stirring, frying, all these various things. Or even a type of chopping. It's not really chopping, I think there is even a slicing chopping. I mean we can have a look if we want to have... It might be interesting to see if we can have some annotations that would be compatible with this."

"The image shows a close-up view of a kitchen counter and floor. On the counter, there is a white cabinet with two black handles, and a potted plant with red flowers. A silver speaker is also visible on the counter. The floor is tiled with a red rug in the background. There are no people or activities depicted in the image, making it difficult to classify.

However, if I were to make an educated guess based on the context of typical home environments, it is likely that this image is related to **Leisure Activities**. The presence of a speaker and the overall home setting suggest a relaxed atmosphere where someone might be enjoying music or other forms of entertainment.

"The image appears to be a candid shot of people gathered around a table, possibly socializing or engaged in a casual activity. The low resolution and motion blur make it difficult to discern specific actions. However, the general atmosphere suggests a relaxed setting, possibly a social gathering or a casual meal. Without clearer details, it's hard to pinpoint a precise activity.

Based on the visual cues, the most fitting category would be **Leisure Activities**. This encompasses a broad range of non-work-related pursuits, which aligns with the relaxed social setting suggested by the image.",554,555," It was a good one. I might think what was it?

Here's why:

*   **Model Kits:** The presence of model airplane kits, particularly the partially assembled one and the instruction sheet, strongly indicates a hobby or leisure activity.
*   **Cards:** A deck of playing cards is also visible, which can be used for various games.
*   **Buzzers:** The colored buzzers suggest a game or a quiz-style activity, which falls under leisure.
*   **Overall Scene:** The informal setting with people gathered around a table, engaged with these items, points towards a relaxed, recreational context.",474,477,

"The most fitting category for this segment is **Playing Games**.

Here's why:

*   **Playing Cards:** There's a deck of cards visible on the table.
*   **Game Buttons:** There are colored buttons on the table that are commonly used for interactive games or quizzes.
*   **Model Kits:** While not explicitly a game, assembling model kits can be a leisure activity that is often done in a social setting, and in this context, combined with the cards and buttons, it suggests a game or activity being played.

The other categories are not supported by the visual evidence.",478,479,
