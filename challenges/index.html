                        The inaugural edition of the CASTLE Challenge features a diverse set of tasks, including event detection, retrieval, and question answering. Future editions will expand the scope, but for this edition, the tasks include:
                    </p>


                    <div class="task-list">
                        <h5>üîç Event Instance Search</h5>
                        <p>
                            Given a textual description (in English), participants must identify all timeframes where a specific event occurs.
                            Events should be reported with both a <strong>time range</strong> and a <strong>video ID</strong>.
                        </p>

                        <h5>üì¶ Object Instance Search</h5>
                        <p>
                            Given a textual (in English) or visual (i.e., using an image) example of a physical object, participants must find all occurrences of that object across any of the video streams.
                        </p>

                        <h5>üí¨ Question Answering</h5>
                        <p>
                            Given a question in natural language (in English), participants must provide an answer. The response should be formulated in natural language and include references to relevant <strong>sensor streams</strong> and <strong>time intervals</strong> as supporting evidence.
                        </p>
